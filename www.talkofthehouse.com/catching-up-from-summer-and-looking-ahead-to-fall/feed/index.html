		<description><![CDATA[Wow Kelly...where to begin...you certainly have had a very busy summer but like you, I have been looking off and on about smaller homes, so I will be anxious to read all about your progress on this adventure. If we decide to go smaller it won&#039;t be for about 4 years (I think). At this point it depends on if our middle daughter and family move to Raleigh, NC. I would like a smaller home (been looking at all of those Tiny House shows on HGTV) with a large barn for the hubby but he wants a barn or industrial style building the we can also take part of it to make our house. Decisions...decisions...but at least we are only in the searching stage. Good luck to you.]]></description>
