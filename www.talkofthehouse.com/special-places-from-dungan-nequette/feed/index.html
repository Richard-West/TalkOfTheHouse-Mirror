		<description><![CDATA[Love looking at all your beautiful decorating!  My question is this:  Did you make the sign/canvas in your sons&#039; room with the 72 on it?  My son is playing football this year, coincidentally 72 is his jersey number,  :)   and I would love to make one for him.  Are there instructions on this site of how you made it or where you bought it?

Thanks!  :)

&lt;em&gt;Hi Terri!
I am so happy you enjoy seeing all the rooms on the blog. I &quot;sort of&quot; made that sign from the boys&#039; room (it is going to live somewhere else soon...I hope.)  It was a square metal chalkboard from Pottery Barn Kids.  It was red at one point, but I painted it yellow, and used a black &quot;chalk pen&quot; to write the 72 on it. I imagine the same thing could be done though with a canvas - paint it yellow and use the black chalk pen to write on it.  It would have a rougher texture, but I think it would still work the same way. Very easy.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  Thank you for the information, eye candy and inspiration. I love it all, as usual. My favorite is that last barn. What an inspiring story and beauty that barn is. This weekend has been full of Homecoming activities , shopping, cleaning and organizing while keeping up with sports, grades and entertaining. I can&#039;t wait to see your gallery wall.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am glad you read the story with the barn. It was such a creative project from start to finish.  You had one busy busy weekend Dawn. Hope next weekend is more relaxing for you.  (My next one is my busy one.)
Kelly &lt;/em&gt; ]]></description>
