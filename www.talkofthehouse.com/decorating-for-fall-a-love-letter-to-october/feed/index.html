		<description><![CDATA[This is funny because when I decorated for fall...before leaving for a trip to Florida...I thought my decorations looked &quot;So Kelly-like&quot;. I copied some of your chalkboards from years past, filled my big jars with candy corn, candy pumpkins, chocolate bars in red wrappers, and was pretty proud of myself. I have to tell you that I miss the 86 degree temperatures that I left in Florida. (It was 30 degrees here the morning I returned.) I think your house looks lovely and I especially like the pumpkin pillow. Is that from Pottery Barn?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh you did good with your decorating!  Brr to 30 degrees.  Our son had snow in New Haven this weekend.  Very hard for me to imagine.  The weather here has been gorgeous today! I am glad you like the pillow.  It is from Pottery Barn!  Good eye. (But I got it at the PB outlet for less than half price. :) )

		<description><![CDATA[Bravo! Oct should be a month to celebrate life and beauty instead of death and ugly. Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Precisely!  I totally agree with you.  I like a little humor thrown in with it as well. :)
