		<description><![CDATA[OMGoodness! How beautiful and I am so excited for a Part 3! It is funny that almost every time I visit my parents (no Internet) you have a post and I am so, so excited to get home to read it. I have to read YOUR post on the &quot;big screen&quot;... not my tiny iphone! LOL! As I was reading I thought that DiAnne would HAVE to go here and LOVED reading her comments. (She actually took our daughter with her back when she went to Canada and New England...such a wonderful gift!) All of the shops and all of the food looked fabulous! I am sorry you didn&#039;t get your sleigh ride but that will certainly give you a reason to go back! I love that you mentioned the piano. Every time my mom goes to a place with a piano, she sits down and plays it...by ear, of course...at 84 years old! Also, whenever I go to a really cool restaurant now I think...What would Kelly take a photo of! And, I take the photos and send them to Katrina. I can&#039;t wait for Part 3! You go, girl!!!]]></description>
