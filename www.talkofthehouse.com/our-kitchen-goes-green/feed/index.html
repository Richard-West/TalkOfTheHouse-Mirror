		<description><![CDATA[You have written many times about making drapes. I don&#039;t really sew but think I can do straight lines! Is it that simple? Can you talk about how to make them, line them (you mention using Walmart plain white sheets) and hang them?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Gosh, I thought I had written a post on making them when I made the ones in our sons&#039; bedroom.  I remember taking photos of it as I went, but that was also when I was sick with bronchitis or something, so I must have not written one.  BUT I will be making some drapes in a week or two, and I will try to get a post out on it and photograph the process then.  It really is as simple as measuring your length, adding about 3 inches to have a hem and a half inch seam at the top, cutting it out, ironing the hem up, pinning and sewing it, then laying the sheet on top with the large band from the sheet about an inch up from the hem bottom, then sewing it all on 3 sides like a giant pillowcase.  If this doesn&#039;t make sense, I hope the post in a few weeks will.

		<description><![CDATA[I just found this on Pinterest.  I love the coffee bar and was wondering what type of jar/dish is holding the coffee scoops?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Althea.  That jar is actually a candle holder that I believe I got at Michaels.  Multi-use container, right? :)
