		<description><![CDATA[Yet another of my favourite movies! Really enjoyed reading about the bakeries. I love to bake for my two boys... and husband ;-) It&#039;s a tough choice, but probably Pioneer Woman&#039;s Cinnamon Rolls... or maybe triple chocolate brownies... or maybe cookies... or maybe a simple Victoria sponge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh...Pioneer Woman&#039;s cinnamon rolls!!  YUM.  My sister makes that for all of us at Christmas.  Triple chocolate brownies sound delicious too. You must like to bake a lot Katherine.  Your family is very lucky then.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m familiar with SB&#039;s jams - wish I were familiar with the restaurant! Wow, that food looks so delicious. I think that&#039;s the biggest hamburger I&#039;ve ever seen, lol.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It was all very delicious!  I could go for one of those hamburgers right now. :)
