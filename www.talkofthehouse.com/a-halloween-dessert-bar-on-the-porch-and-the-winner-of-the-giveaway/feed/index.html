		<description><![CDATA[I am so excited about your workroom.  Can&#039;t wait to see what you do with it and what color you use.
I am at my daughter&#039;s home and we are putting up Christmas trees!  I know it is way to early....but we put up so many we need a week.
This was the only time we could work it out.
I came expecting to put up 5, but just finished our seventh tree last night!!! 
We have a great time...that&#039;s what retirement is all about!
Cindy

&lt;em&gt;7 trees ...oh my!  (And just think, you get to undecorate that many as well. :) ) Yes, retirement is looking better and better.
