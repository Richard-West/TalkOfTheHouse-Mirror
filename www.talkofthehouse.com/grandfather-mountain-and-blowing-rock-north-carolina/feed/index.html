		<description><![CDATA[I love the Mitford Series books and anything else Jan Karon has written.  Would love to visit Blowing Rock.  I wish there was a little village depicting Mitford with all the village shops, Father Tim&#039;s church and rectory, the other characters homes,etc. to visit.

&lt;em&gt;That would be a fun place to see Nancy.  Blowing Rock is pretty close in my mind though....especially the church there.

		<description><![CDATA[My husband and I will celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in February, so I have been researching places for us to go. Usually I am a &#039;wanna go to Charleston, SC&#039; girl when it comes to special trips, but this time I think we will head up to western NC. It will also be my husband&#039;s 50th birthday trip, and he loves the mountains! So, I&#039;ve been re-reading your posts about Blowing Rock (and Mitford), Grandfather Mtn., Mast General Store, etc. to get ideas. I am a Jan Karon Mitford book series fanatic, so I&#039;m not having to sacrifice very much. LOL Hopefully, we will visit the Biltmore House in Asheville first, then head on up to Boone/Blowing Rock/Grandfather Mountain. I&#039;m also looking into Bed/Breakfasts and lodges in the area. I&#039;ve read about the Beaufort House in Asheville, and it looks awesome. Now to find other lodging for our second destination. The planning and researching is so much fun , and although we probably won&#039;t actually go until May, I am beyond excited! If we have time, we may even make it up to Mt. Airy. 
Thanks for sharing about these wonderful places.
Blessings,
Amy

&lt;em&gt;Congratulations on your 25th anniversary Amy (and happy birthday to your husband!)  That will be a great trip, and I know both of you will love being in that beautiful area. I am happy that you are enjoying the blog posts.  They were fun to write!  (and looking at the photos allows me to &quot;revisit&quot; them in my mind.)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
