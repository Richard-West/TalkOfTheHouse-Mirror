		<description><![CDATA[I would like to change my counter tops I have oak cabinets, we built our home 20 years ago. The counter tops are now Formica, I&#039;m not crazy about granite, I liked your idea of wood, but how would I do that with my stained oak cabinets, would I need to paint the cabinets?
thank you for you time,
kerri
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That would be a good bit of wood to have both the countertops and the cabinets themselves stained.  I would probably recommend painting the cabinets like you said Kerri.  (And I have never painted oak, so I do not know the best procedure for that.)
