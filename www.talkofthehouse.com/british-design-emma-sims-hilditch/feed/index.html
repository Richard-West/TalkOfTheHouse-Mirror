		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting--- had not heard of this designer. Looks like real people live there-- love the library wall! When we were in London, I really enjoyed the heated towel racks but the weather was too rainy, damp and foggy for me. The thatched roofs were fascinating and loved the daffodils that  were in bloom all over the countryside.  Also enjoyed high tea and all the wonderful finger sandwiches and pastries. I helped chaperone my daughter&#039;s high school choral group that toured for 10 days and performed there. My oldest daughter went too as RN to care for any ills of the 130 students. A wonderful trip for all and spent Palm Sunday at St. Paul&#039;s which was a wonderful experience of a life time!
----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That sounds like a dream trip, Louvina!  A heated towel rack alone would be heaven. Being at St. Paul’s cathedral for Palm Sunday would be amazing! Thank you for sharing the memory of your trip.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  I am wondering if the mystery room is sort of butlers pantry/laundry room/wet bar area? Our laundry room is right next to our master bedroom and it has a door between the two that leads into my side our closet. One of the best decisions I made when designing our house plans.
------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;em&gt;Your laundry sounds like what I just pinned on pinterest this week…a laundry next to the master closet.  That was a brilliant decision in space design! 
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
