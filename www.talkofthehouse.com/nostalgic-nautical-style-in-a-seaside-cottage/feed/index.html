		<description><![CDATA[Just a side note for Karen, &quot;Garden, Home and Party&quot;, I believe the fireplace is constructed of coquina (sedimentary rock made up of shells and remains of sea animals). The walls of the fort in St. Augustine  are made of this type of material.

&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the info!
