		<description><![CDATA[Last year I was blessed to go to a wedding in North Carolina during pollen season.  I had no idea where all that pollen came from!  My word, that&#039;s a lot of pollen.  Here in Washington state, we don&#039;t have that beautiful yellow covering over everything.  I hear I may be out there again for a certain little baby&#039;s arrival.  How is October for visiting?
Gabbie did a wonderful job taking over the post, she may need to make an appearance again sometime.

&lt;em&gt;Yes it IS a lot of pollen in the spring, but you will be fine in October, Linda.  Thank you for reading Gabbie&#039;s post!  Yes, she may need to take over again when I am busy. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Gabbie, you did an awesome job of decorating (and cleaning).  I&#039;m sure you really did need a nap afterwards.  I love those blue pillows.  Have a wonderful Easter and hope you get a lot of treats.  Happy Easter to Mom and Dad also.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I&#039;ll be sure to pass your sweet words on to Gabbie, Kathy. :) She is very good at napping.  I&#039;m so glad you liked those blue pillows.  I have had them a loooong time, but they still do well as an accent.  Gabbie got a new collar and leash and some extra treats for Easter.  Of course her new collar is gingham!  Hope you had a very nice Easter Sunday!
