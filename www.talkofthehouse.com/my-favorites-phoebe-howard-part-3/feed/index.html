		<description><![CDATA[I have enjoyed these posts and seeing where some of the photos I have pinned originated from.

It is not a balmy 80 here in N Texas, but 28 with chances of flurries for the next 3 days!   I think Mother Nature has her radars mixed up!

I began keeping my new granddaughter last week and am trying to get on a schedule.  It turns out to be much like the one when I taught school!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Wanda â€“ You must be another Phoebe Howard fan, too! Mother Nature is definitely having fun with us lately. Are you all blanketed with snow by now? How funny that you are back to a school schedule! I am looking forward to an upcoming 3 day weekend.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

As usual another inspiring post!  And again as I read your words of warmth and sunshine I look out the window to see that it is snowing... Yet again!  My wish for a white Christmas was fulfilled -and more!  Mother Nature had so much fun with it that she forgot to turn it off.  Some people are able to ski from their front door... And they live in the middle of the city (the plows don&#039;t get everywhere).

Anyway,  I love this series and yet again my favourite room is -wait for it- the porch!  I am so consistent  it&#039;s crazy!  

Enjoy your lovely summer (for Calgary) weather!

Cath

&lt;em&gt;Cath â€“ Nothing wrong with being consistent! Just shows you know what you like. :) I loved Phoebe Howardâ€™s porches, just like you.
Ski from their front doorâ€¦wow! Speaking of snow, our 75 degree weather just yesterday has turned into snow flurries tonight! (We wonâ€™t get any accumulation..boo hoo.) I think Mother Nature must enjoy playing tricks on all of us lately.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
