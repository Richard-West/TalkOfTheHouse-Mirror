		<description><![CDATA[As a busy, busy educator I am just now reading this post. Thank you for appealing to many of our senses through Talk of the House.  I am preparing for Thanksgiving and pre-thinking Christmas.  The pictures of your church and beautiful music link you shared were perfect.  Thank you Kelly. I have the copy of the magazine featuring your home at Christmas.  Love it and proud of you too.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;If you are an educator, I know just how precious your time is.  So thank you for reading the post and leaving such a thoughtful comment.  I am glad you enjoyed all of it.  And thank you for purchasing the BHG Christmas Ideas magazine!  We are very happy with how the article turned out.  If you haven&#039;t seen the winter issue of Southern Cottage, they too, have an article featuring our home.  It is a rework of one from a number of years ago in Cottages and Bungalows.
Hope you have today off and that you are enjoying it (and not grading papers!)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just catching up on some computer time. Your post was absolutely beautiful. What a lovely church and stable. My daughter, Claire, used to have a thing for Nativities when she was little. I think she had six of them, in all shapes and sizes. Everyone here has had some kind of bug, so we have been really low-key (lazy) for the last two weeks. Not a good start to New Year Resolutions for exercise and cleaining up the house...LOL! Enjoy the rest of the remaining holiday season. I look forward to following your posts in 2015.]]></description>
