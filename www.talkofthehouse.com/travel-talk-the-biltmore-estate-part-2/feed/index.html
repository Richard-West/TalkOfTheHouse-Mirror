		<description><![CDATA[After driving past Biltmore annually for more than 20 years on our trip from Chicago to Kiawah Island, SC, we finally stopped to visit last year. What an amazing home and how sad that he really did not get to live there that long. I was blown away by the forested drive up to the house right thru the kitchen, laundry and swimming pool. What attention to detail in every space. Thanks for taking me back!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Wow, this is like Downton.  It&#039;s so amazing to me that a 26 year old had the foresight to incorporate all of the wonderful amenities he included.  I can&#039;t wait to see this mansion. Did you tour it all in one day?
xo,
Karen

&lt;em&gt;I know...at 26 who would have been able to do that??? Yes, we did tour it all in one day...with time to spare. We even did a bit of the trails.  If you wanted to do all of them, it would have probably filled the entire day.  You really need to make a trip to NC...so many pretty places to see!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
