		<description><![CDATA[Your home wears red so beautifully. I never tire of looking at your ingenious use of it.  I&#039;m a very traditional person. My children, who are now 40 and 37, expect the tree to have our family ornaments, gifts to them through the years from grandparents and aunts. We tried to change things up when we moved to the farm, but no.  And now our grandson comes to help decorate and those ornaments are becoming part of his story. 
Merry Christmas, Kelly! I hope your family was all home to share the joys of Christmas.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thanks Peggy!  You KNOW I love red!  (It is such a happy color! :) ) Love how your traditions are passing from one generation to the next. Our sons were home for Christmas, but our daughter spent the holiday with her future in-laws.  (Totally understandable. :) )
Many blessings to you for 2018.  Happy New Year!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
