		<description><![CDATA[I love all the maps and globes...and thank you so much for introducing me to Meg&#039;s house.  It is to DIE for!  Effortless chic at its finest.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Aimee â€“ Isnâ€™t Megâ€™s house the coolest thing?? I just love all the color and pattern â€“ something I am not quite brave enough to do here. Maybe she will give me courage. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
These are great rooms and I agree with your reader that school style can be fun while still supporting a sophisticated vibe, like in the later House Beautiful room.  I love vintage globes.
Have a great weekend.
Karen

&lt;em&gt;Karen â€“ So glad you liked the globes and all! Who would have ever dreamed they would have made it into House Beautiful rooms?! Hope you had a good weekend.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
