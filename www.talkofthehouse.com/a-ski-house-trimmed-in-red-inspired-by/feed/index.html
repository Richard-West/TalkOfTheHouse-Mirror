		<description><![CDATA[This retreat is amazing!  It&#039;s a perfect place to escape inside and play outside.  So carefully designed with each detail complimenting the concept.  Love this!  Thank you for sharing!
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am so glad you liked the house, Trisha.  They obviously put a great deal of thought into all the details - especially the rooms for the children. And I loved all the red..perfect for warming up a house in the snow.  Have a good week!

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, how wonderful to have such a beautiful retreat.  Love everything about it, except for the fact that it has no access road?  I don&#039;t think I would like that.  Wonderful share.

&lt;em&gt;It is a lovely home.  The resort advertises that you must take a gondola up, but surely there is a road...at least for construction access?  Not sure...
Have a great week, Debra!
