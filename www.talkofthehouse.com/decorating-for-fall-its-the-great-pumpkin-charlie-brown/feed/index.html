		<description><![CDATA[How perfect! Charlie Brown!! I don&#039;t always watch the cartoons every year-- but will watch parts-- my favorite part is when he says, &quot; I GOT A ROCK!&quot; Always makes me chuckle!!:) but I would have never thought to put a rock in a bag!! What a funny idea!! Love it! This post was so cheery and unique-- I like how you think. When do you get all these different ideas? Do you have a notebook that you jot down when the light bulb goes on? Keep up the great posts-- we love them!!:)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Poor Charlie Brown with his rocks! :( When do I get all these ideas?  Sometimes when I am watching the show (like the detail of the invitation to Violet&#039;s party) and other times from something on pinterest that I tweak to fit what I am doing, and yes, I most definitely keep a notebook with lists of ideas and shopping lists.  I HAVE to write things down to remember them! :)
