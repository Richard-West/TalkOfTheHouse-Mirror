		<description><![CDATA[Love your blog. Just found it today. BTW, you might want to read up on making corn in a cooler. It&#039;s not good for the plastic to heat up as it releases chemicals you really don&#039;t want to ingest. I was bummed when I found that out - cooking large amounts of corn is time consuming and a cooler would speed things up!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you visiting Kim!  Welcome!  And thanks for the info on the cooler...I had no idea, but that makes perfect sense.  I guess we will have to resort to a huge pot on the side burner of our grill.
