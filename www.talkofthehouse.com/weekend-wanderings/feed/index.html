		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
What charming places.  Who knew there were such great inns and &quot;resorts&quot; from schoolhouse beginnings.  I always enjoy the recipes of Jenny Steffens. Since they just moved I assume it may be a bit of time before we get any new recipes.
Have a wonderful weekend.  I sure enjoyed your school house series.
Karen

&lt;em&gt;Karen – I found a site – not sure where – that tells about all these inns made from “different” beginnings – factories, schools, libraries. I should have bookmarked it. I believe you are right about Jenny taking some time before she sends us any new recipes. Moving is a lot of work!
Thank you for being such a faithful reader!
