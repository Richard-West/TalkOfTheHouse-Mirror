		<description><![CDATA[Such classic styling, and yet, if I may be biased, there is the feel of traditional New England - yes? I think I love best the porch fronting the Crane estate &quot;cottage&quot;, it&#039;s so deep and cozy looking. But, those kitchens, how about that walk-in pantry? Sigh, you really know how to tease us with the eye candy, don&#039;t you, Kelly! Was this the back-to=school week (or should I not mention that?), if so, I hope things got off to a good start. I cannot believe that August will be here tomorrow... soon we will begin to see the shadows deepen and the late afternoon light will have subtly begun to change. In the mornings or at night, there will be cooler temps that remind us of a new season. But, for now, I am off to the Cape and will be enjoying time with old friends, including the beach! (Today, we are &quot;lunching&quot; at the swanky Wequasset Inn on the coast in Chatham - I know there will be some fun shopping on Main Street afterwards. Hello, Candy Manor!)
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Most definitely a feel of classic New England. :)  Yes, this was the back to school week....waaaaay too early.  I don&#039;t know what in the world they were thinking!  I hope you had fun in Chatham...love that little town!

		<description><![CDATA[I love the lighting in the cabinets! Oh, all the things I would add if I could go back and rebuild our house! All the things I would leave out! haha!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I meant to mention that lighting too. Wasn&#039;t that just great?!  I would love to add that to our cabinets in the kitchen here too.
