		<description><![CDATA[Dear Kelly,
Thanks for featuring my books, The Traveling Tea Ladies Tea Murder Mysteries in your book giveaway.
Some of your readers were trying to locate them in their local libraries. If your library doesn&#039;t carry them, you can request they place an order through their ordering channels, but they are available at Amazon &#038; Barnes &#038; Noble in paperback, hardback and e-book format.
It&#039;s good to see so many people love tea, mysteries and Fall as much as I do. Your house is gorgeous, as usual, and perfectly decorated for the season. 
Thank you Kelly again for featuring the books! I hope to do another book giveaway with your readers in the near future.

Until Our Next Pot of Tea,
Melanie O&#039;Hara
Author of &quot;The Traveling Tea Ladies&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Melanie, thank you so very much for allowing me to share your books with the readers here!  I know our winner will love them all!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
