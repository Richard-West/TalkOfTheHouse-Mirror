		<description><![CDATA[I love them both, for different reasons: the first one is so fun and has a collected vibe...perfect for a second home!  I could see living in the second one every day, though.  I love the neutrals and yes, even the bust in the dining room!

&lt;em&gt;Aimee ‚Äì I totally agree with you, although I think I could see raising little children more in the first one than the second one‚Ä¶guess it just depends on what stage you are at in life. I think the second one is more ‚Äúmy style‚Äù (minus the bust :) ), but then I am at an ‚Äúolder children‚Äù stage. Thank you so much for reading and leaving your comments here today!

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, I am in LOVE with the little green cottage you featured first. It makes me smile every time I look at it. I especially like the last picture you posted of it - the yellow wall with the white ceiling reminds me of the sun. Who wouldn&#039;t love to live there?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Isn‚Äôt that little cottage the cutest thing Kayleigh? It just has ‚Äúhappy‚Äù written all over it. I can see why they named it Monkey Cottage! You could certainly play and monkey around in it.
