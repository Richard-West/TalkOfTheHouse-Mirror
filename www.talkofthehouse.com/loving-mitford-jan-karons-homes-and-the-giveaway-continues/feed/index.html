		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I am on the board of the Friends of the Library for Burke County in Morganton, NC. Each year we have a luncheon in March and invite a visiting author. We would dearly love to have Jan Karon be our visiting author on March 19th, 2015. We have money to pay an author but we do not know the best way to contact her. We wrote to her publisher but did not hear back from them. Her new book will be out and she could do a book signing while she is here. We would love to decorate for her. We usually have about 150 people for the luncheon and we decorate twenty tables. I saw the website of the  virtual tour of her home in Virgina. Her decor is beautiful and charming. I am sure she would love orchids, candles, teapots and cups and flowers in the tradition of the English garden.  If you have suggestions of the best way to contact her please let me know. If she cannot come we would be disappointed but it would let us know to look for someone else. She is very popular in Morganton and has been to our book store &quot;Muses&quot; before but that bookstore in now closed. I hope you can give us some suggestions as to how to reach her.
Thank you very much.    Joann Tanzer     jo_tee@yahoo.com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My desire is to get a message to Jan Karon.  Is this the avenue?  Having read all the Mitford series I was delighted to find this newest book.  Such sweet wholesome characters and experiences.  I wish I could be more like Fr Tim - accepting all just as they are; the recognition of who they are; no judgement.  When I finished Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good, I felt the door is open for a sequel.  Thank goodness.  I enjoyed the opportunity this book afforded to review past events and the folks involved.  I am grateful for Jan Karon&#039;s talent - and messages.  Thank you.

&lt;em&gt;Hi Betty! I am afraid this is not a link to Ms. Karon.  If I were you, I would try either her Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/JanKaron) or through the Penguin books page (her publisher.)  I don&#039;t think Ms. Karon is even aware of the blog posts here on her homes.  I loved her newest book too, and yes, I felt the door is definitely open for a sequel.  Wasn&#039;t it good to be back in Mitford with all our old friends?  I too am grateful for her writing talent.
I hope you are having a splendid Sunday!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
