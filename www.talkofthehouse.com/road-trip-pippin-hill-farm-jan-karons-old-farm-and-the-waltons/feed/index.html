		<description><![CDATA[That was a fun trip too! My daddy thinks he has never had alcohol but he drank a mimosa at my brother&#039;s wedding brunch. (We never told him it had alcohol.) I have to tell you, I have a glass of wine almost every night with dinner. Are you still my friend? Those sliders look delicious! If you make it to Dillsboro, there is a restaurant called Coach&#039;s. They have THE BEST pork chop sliders!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It was a very fun trip and covered a lot of ground.  How funny that your daddy did not know the mimosa was alcoholic!  Yes, you can still be my friend even if you do drink a glass of wine every night. :) I think I have read that alcohol in moderation may actually have some health benefits.  We will look for Coach&#039;s the next time we go to Dillsboro.  I think that is where the train station is that&#039;s where you start the train ride through the mountains. Pork chop sliders sound like something all the guys around here would love!

		<description><![CDATA[The Waltons was my favorite show growing up - how fun this is! Did you go into the house?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Wasn&#039;t it a great show?!  I had no idea it ran for 9 years until I started doing some research on it.  No, we only went in the general store there.  We had to get back on the road to head back home.
