		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, this is an incredible post!!! Do you know what I&#039;ve been trying to do for the past week?! Make my kitchen more cozy and inviting....I&#039;m horrible with creating vignettes. My kitchen is pretty bare b/c I have no idea on how to style it. I feel it always ends up looking cluttered. I&#039;m totally going to steal some of these ideas. We have an area in our kitchen that is screaming for a vignette....I&#039;m going to go through and make some notes and draw some things out. I sketch everything - invitation designs, dessert displays and now looks like I&#039;m going ot have to sketch some kitchen ideas. I&#039;m going out of town for work for a couple of days and now after reading this I just want to stay home and nest. Thanks so much!!

&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth, sketching it out is such a great idea! I do that with a lot of things at work. I‚Äôm so happy you are able to use some of the ideas here, so you go right ahead and steal whatever you need. Thank you for your wonderful comments here!

		<description><![CDATA[I love all these elements, and like you am constantly styling . But.... Where is the coffee pot and toaster?  Those 2 appliances are daiy in my house!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Wanda, that is a VERY good question. I don‚Äôt remember seeing a coffee pot in any of these..hmmm. We don‚Äôt have a toaster,but one entire counter in my kitchen is devoted to ‚Äúthe coffee bar.‚Äù I hope to do a run through of my kitchen vignettes tomorrow, and it WILL have a coffee pot (or two.) :)
