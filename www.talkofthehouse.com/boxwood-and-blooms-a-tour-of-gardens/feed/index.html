		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to try to get to this garden tour this year, but my husband and I ended up planting fifteen Nellie R. Stevens hollies over the weekend.  Thanks for posting pictures from the tour, it adds some inspiration to do more yard work.  Have a wonderful weekend!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You did have such a nice Mother&#039;s Day weekend!  Garden walks are always fun and inspiring.  Hosta is in abundance in my backyard.  I keeping adding more, as they are great fillers and are so low maintenance.  I love ferns too.  I have just now started to add them as well.  I spent all day yesterday planting flats of impatiens.  Lots more to do, but Mother Nature brought rain last night, so I will give my body a much needed rest today.  The sounds of birds tweets as I type and look out the kitchen bay window...Oh, Nature, soothing to the soul.  :)]]></description>
