		<description><![CDATA[Love everything that Disney does!! You always know there will be &quot;Magic&quot; and the details will be perfect!! I love the topiaries! On my my first trip to WDW I remember being so facinated with them and still one of my favorite things!! Would love to go on one of their cruises.  What is your favorite thing Disney? The Villages where I taught was built on the Disney &quot;idea&quot; and Celebration was the inspiration. You would love The Villages-- there is so much to do and so beautiful. Hope you are having a nice Monday. Going straight into summer here!!]]></description>
