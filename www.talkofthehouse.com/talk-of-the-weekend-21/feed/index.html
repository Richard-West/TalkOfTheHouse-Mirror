		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

I love these homes.  Norman Askins has been a favorite for some time.
That strawberry cheesecake shortcake looks dangerous.  Just hand me a fork and a comfy place to sit while I savor each bite!
Hope your storms are long gone.  We&#039;re experiencing summer weather, ugh.

&lt;em&gt;His work is just fabulous.  I am with you on that shortcake looking dangerous!  Summer weather this early? Guess that is what the weather is like in California. :)
