		<description><![CDATA[Kelly all of your April posts about Tybee Island were so inspiring.I booked a family vacation in late summer at the Breeze Inn. And my engaged daughter plans to check out the wedding chapel while we are there. Your travelogue has shown us the richness and beauty of the area before we even arrive. Thanks so much!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am thrilled that the posts inspired you, Faye!  How fun that you are going to be staying in the Breeze Inn!!! (I am jealous. :) )  I hope your daughter finds the wedding chapel to be exactly what she is looking for for her wedding. It would be a gorgeous place for it!
