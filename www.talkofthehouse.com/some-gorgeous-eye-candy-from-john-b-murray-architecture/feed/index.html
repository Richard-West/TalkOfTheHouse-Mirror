		<description><![CDATA[Loved them all!! Will definitely go to his website to check out more of his work! All of the houses you showed were absolutely gorgeous and just what I would want were I in the position to have a home designed for my family!

		<description><![CDATA[I have to say I am swooning over too many of the pictures in this post.  I am a traditionalist, tried and true.  From that large farm table with Windsor chairs (yep, that&#039;s my kitchen), though I love that glassed room with the wicker chairs all around, in that summer cottage....Dining with nature from sunrise to sunsets....how lovely.  I love that cedar shingled siding..(Hampton&#039;s)...ugh!  Those built in beds are quickly becoming a favorite of mine too.  From the spacious bath to the lovely pool area....like I said...Swooning!  Sigh!

&lt;em&gt;I think you liked them all Debra!  Yes, you must be a traditionalist through and through. :)
