		<description><![CDATA[I just now spotted this post on your travel talk so, of course, I have another comment. Your accommodations were kitty-corner from my hubby&#039;s office. Did you happen to notice Fairbank Construction? Small world!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh my goodness.  Definitely a small world!  I believe Fairbank&#039;s office was right up the street towards town - near the Gelato place.  I just loved Bainbridge Island.  You are in such a wonderful part of our country!
