		<description><![CDATA[I was just wondering where you purchased the wall baskets above the desk?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Karrin, they were purchased at Target - on the bathroom accessory aisle.  Unfortunately, I have not seen any exactly like them there recently.  They do have some similar ones though, and I have also seen similar ones  on the same aisle in Walmart.

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
The room is beautiful!  I loved the before too, but the yellow looks amazing!  I adore the black and white checked drapes too.  I think whatever you decide...is going to be perfect.  I do love the idea of a corner gallery wall, especially after seeing your examples.  I was just reading your posts on your house design.  So interesting.

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Annie!  I am addicted to checks, and black and white plays so well with other colors.  Love your vote of confidence!  Looking forward to seeing your finished gallery wall. :)
