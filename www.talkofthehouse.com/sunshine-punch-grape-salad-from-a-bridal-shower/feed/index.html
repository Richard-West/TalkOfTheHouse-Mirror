		<description><![CDATA[Please forgive me for writing a comment to this post now in the new year, Kelly, but I only discovered your blog about a month ago and am now just finding the time to go back and read them from the beginning.  Your question concerning having a &quot;go-to&quot; punch reminded me of the apple cider punch that I served at my daughters baby shower and again a year later at Lily&#039;s 1st. birthday party.  Here&#039;s what you need to enjoy this wonderful punch:  6 cups of apple cider, 2 cups of orange juice, cranberry-raspberry juice, or orange-mango juice (I&#039;ve only ever used the orange juice), 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and 1 750 milliliter bottle of sparkling white grape juice or sparkling wine.  In punch bowl or large pitcher, combine first three ingredients.  Slowly add white grape juice or wine. Serve immediately.  For an adult punch, use chilled champagne in place of the grape juice. Enjoy!

&lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t apologize Lindy!  Thank you so much for sharing your apple cider punch.  It sounds positively delicious. :)
