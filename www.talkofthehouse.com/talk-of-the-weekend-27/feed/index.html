		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

Congratulations on your official retirement!  I retired this year also and after reading your blog in May, I can say that I know exactly how you felt...I described it pretty much as you did...just like that, my 43 year career was over.  It was sad, it was exciting, it was scary...but in the end, it was good.
Glad you got diagnosis and meds to treat it...here&#039;s hoping you are feeling better soon.
I enjoy your blog so much.  Take care and Happy August!
