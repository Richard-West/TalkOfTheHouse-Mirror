		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly!  I&#039;m one of the Grove Street Press girls :)  Thank you so much for the share!  I loved this post -- so many cute finds.  And green is my favorite color, to boot!

Such a happy surprise to find us here -- I started following you not too long ago after I pinned your (gorgeous!!) kitchen as the main inspiration for my husband&#039;s and my current kitchen renovation.  Been coming here ever since for more inspiration!

Happy to have connected with you, and I look forward to keeping up the conversation!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;What a small world Kate!!  Love everything you two do!  And if we ever get a lake house, I want to use some of your prints and cards (framed) as artwork for the house.  (But right now the lake house is just a dream....sigh.)  My daughter was in New Orleans for a few days with a mission group (Team Effort) last summer, and I tried to get her to go by your shop, but they did not have enough free time for it.  Hopefully we will get to visit NOLA one day and can check it out ourselves.  Your Instagram feed is just gorgeous, as is your dog!  Wish I could get my lab puppy to be as well behaved as Mildred. :)  I read your post on your cute home renovation, and hope to see more of it over on the blog at GSP.
Thank you so much for stopping by the blog, and thank you for loving our kitchen!  
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
