		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t get to Habersham on this trip to Beaufort, but it gives me an excuse to go back again. I am also a native Vermonter ( like your reader Lisa) transplanted to Massachusetts 30 years ago. Vermont is beautiful, no place like it on earth, but the older I get the more I crave some warmth and sunshine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the lovely words about Habersham.  My family was lucky enough to get transferred to South Carolina in 2003.  We found a lovely home with double wrap around porches that face one of the many parks.  Great place to have coffee each day and visit with our wonderful neighbors.  Habersham is a wonderful place to live.

&lt;em&gt;Thank YOU for your sweet comment, Pat!  Habersham was gorgeous, and you are so very lucky to be living there.  I am jealous! :)  Thank you for reading the post.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
