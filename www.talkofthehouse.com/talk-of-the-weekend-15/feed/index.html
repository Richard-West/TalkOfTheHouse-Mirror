		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed the random wanderings of this post! I have not had time look at all of it as I have been randomly doing a lot of different things myself! But at my happy place beachside-- even if it is down in the 30&#039;s and only 55 degrees today. Going to look at some little beach houses tomorrow-- little in size but not in price!:)Going to have Chinese or NY Pizza for Super Bowl Sunday. Always wanted to have a party but never did. I do like to look at all the great ideas though---How does it feel having your house back to normal? Looking forward to the next post!]]></description>
