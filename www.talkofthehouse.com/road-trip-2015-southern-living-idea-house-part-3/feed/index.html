		<description><![CDATA[I drug my husband to the idea house after reading this blog. I have to say...Photographs don&#039;t do it justice, although yours are 110percent better than mine the house was somehow warmer and more welcoming in person.  I wanted to lay my face on the Kitchen Island and tell it how beautiful it was. The kitchen was much lovelier than any of the photographs even though it was so white...  They told us that the house had been sold for 2.2 million and I am sure the first thing the new owners do is screen in that porch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;The new owners SHOULD screen in that porch. LOL  I am so glad you got to see it in person, Betty and that you found it to be a warm and inviting place.

		<description><![CDATA[I have been away for 10 days and am just catching up. I just read all of the comments and realized there were lots of readers who felt the same way I did about the decorating style inside the house. When I read the comments on the first few posts I thought of &quot;The Emperors New Clothes&quot;....I was like...Really? They love this style? I do like the outside better than the inside. The kitchen porch is my favorite and I love that sink as well. Do you like the olive buckets beside the sink? I like your style of using black and white family photos in black frames as artwork. I would like to see some of your mother&#039;s artwork though. I bet you get your creativity from her.

&lt;em&gt;You have done a lot of catching up Kathy!  Thank you for taking the time to read all the posts you missed and comment on so many of them!  (You should get an award for that. :) ) Yes, the porches are the favorite of so many of us.  Love that sink!  I like the olive buckets beside the sink...not sure what I would do with a bucket that doesn&#039;t hold much though. LOL Guess I could put something inside it if I wanted to use them to hold flowers.
I probably do get my creativity from my mother and also my love of houses.  She started it years ago when we would go &quot;riding&quot; to just look at houses in Mobile, Alabama. :)
