			<div class="article-content sc" data-role="content">

				<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-tablescape-Talk-of-the-House-1024x683(pp_w755_h503).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22528" width="755" height="503" alt="Thanksgiving tablescape Talk of the House" />I don&#8217;t normally like to begin our home tours in the dining room, but being that this one is for Thanksgiving, I think it is only appropriate.  The dining room and kitchen are kind of the stars of the show when it comes to Thanksgiving. So come in the side door that all our family and friends use, down that tiny hall, and enter the dining room here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dining-room-Thanksgiving-732x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22529" width="732" height="1024" alt="dining room Thanksgiving" /> Do you notice anything new? 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bench-1024x701(pp_w755_h516).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22530" width="755" height="516" alt="bench" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>No I am not talking about the drapes.  We&#8217;ll talk about them in a minute.</em> The bench &#8211; did you notice the bench? We purchased it a few weeks ago for the dining room.  It was on sale at Pier 1, and I thought it went perfectly with the casual feel of our table.  The extra chairs moved upstairs to my husband&#8217;s office where they were needed, so we had fun playing musical chairs. 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now let&#8217;s look at the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-tablescape-717x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22531" width="717" height="1024" alt="Thanksgiving tablescape" />All the red and orange accents have left the house and have been replaced with browns and greens and neutrals.  I&#8217;ve said before that I think October is a playful month, and November is a reverent&#8230;respectful month&#8230;.a month we really make a point to reflect on our many blessings. (But we <em>should</em> do that all the time.) As much as I adore all things red, I think all the neutrals fit more with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-place-setting-1024x695(pp_w755_h512).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22534" width="755" height="512" alt="Thanksgiving place setting" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So the red buffalo check drapes have been replaced with the green plaid ones.  (The red will be back for Christmas though.) The wonderful <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=17904.html" target="_blank">Williams Sonoma turkey pieces</a> from my relatives are back in use. I have mixed brown and green everywhere I can&#8230;.even pulling out our old olive green pottery to use in the centerpiece along with green and cream colored pumpkins and magnolia leaves.  (You will see in the next post that I have gone overboard with the use of magnolia branches!)  Today I am so thankful to live where I do &#8211; between the forest and the field &#8211; where Nature does such a wonderful job providing beauty for all the seasons &#8211; and especially Thanksgiving. 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dining-room-for-Thanksgiving-669x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22532" width="669" height="1024" alt="dining room for Thanksgiving" />Have you noticed the little word searches beside each place setting?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/place-card-Thanksgiving-wordsearch-1024x743(pp_w755_h547).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22536" width="755" height="547" alt="place card Thanksgiving wordsearch" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> The idea for these goes <em>totally</em> to Ashlee at the cute <em>very</em> vintage blog, <em><a href="http://www.mysocalledcraftylife.com/2012/11/21/thanksgiving-word-search-place-cards/" target="_blank">My So Called Crafty Life</a></em>. (So don&#8217;t give me any credit for them!)  I wanted something other than traditional place cards for our Thanksgiving table, and when I saw these on Pinterest, I knew they would be fun. (We are a competitive bunch, so bring on the games!)  Anyway, I copied Ashlee&#8217;s to a word document, saved it as photo, then opened it up in Picasa to remove her heading and add in my green one.  You should be able to do the same with mine here.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Then I made word searches with <a href="http://puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com/WordSearchSetupForm.asp" target="_blank">Puzzle Maker</a> because I was familiar with using it in my classroom.  Ashlee used a different website.  It took me awhile because I inserted our family member&#8217;s names at each place card&#8230;so that required individualizing 6 different ones, and the words are printed horizontally at the bottom on Puzzle Maker.  I had to copy them as images and paste them on to my card to get them in the vertical list.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It would be easier to just use a last name or all of your guests names in <em>one</em> puzzle to save time. But to<em> really</em> save time, I am putting one here that is just a general Thanksgiving word search without the &#8220;people names&#8221; if you would like to use it. 🙂  Right click on it.  Copy the image. Paste to an open document on your computer. You might want to resize it to a smaller image.  Then print away as many as you need.  I printed ours on cardstock and trimmed them down to the size I wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-word-search-for-table.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22539" width="624" height="623" alt="Thanksgiving word search for table" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And that is the extent of my tech knowledge.<br />
Truly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now to the rest of the dining room&#8230;The antique cupboard in the corner holds that beautiful platter that matches the salad plates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-vignette-antique-cupboard-658x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22542" width="658" height="1024" alt="Thanksgiving vignette antique cupboard" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I pulled out one of the pottery bowls to use there as well.<img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-vignette-1024x736(pp_w755_h542).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22543" width="755" height="542" alt="Thanksgiving vignette" />And a piece of the pottery was also used in the cabinet on the other wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dining-room-cabinet-Thanksgiving-vignettes-1024x804(pp_w755_h592).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22544" width="755" height="592" alt="dining room cabinet Thanksgiving vignettes" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/kitchen-window-green-plaid-drapes-688x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22547" width="688" height="1024" alt="kitchen window green plaid drapes" />The October orange cookbooks have been shelved on the family room bookcase.<br />
Green and brown ones are in use now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Talk-of-the-House-kitchen-corner-641x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22548" width="641" height="1024" alt="Talk of the House kitchen corner" />It is a much calmer look for this month<br />
(although Thanksgiving cooking is <em>anything</em> but calm!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Talk-of-the-House-kitchen-cabinets-1024x684(pp_w755_h504).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22549" width="755" height="504" alt="Talk of the House kitchen cabinets" />The coffee trays are wearing brown and green for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ring-tags-on-coffee-jars-for-coffee-tray-1024x671(pp_w755_h494).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22550" width="755" height="494" alt="ring tags on coffee jars for coffee tray" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">More pottery made its way into a small vignette atop the refrigerator.<br />
(Love the battery powered candle up there!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/refrigerator-fall-vignette-1024x688(pp_w755_h507).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22552" width="755" height="507" alt="refrigerator fall vignette" />And finally, a recipe for what to do with leftover turkey is on the kitchen desk chalkboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/kitchen-desk-614x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22553" width="614" height="1024" alt="kitchen desk" />I hope you have enjoyed this part of the tour today.  For those of you who are lovers of bright colors, I promise you the red will return in December. 🙂   I just think November needs a different look between Halloween and the celebration of Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;ll wander out on the porches for part 2 here.  And I will go ahead and tell you that the table does <em>not</em> look like what you see through the door in the photo below.  That was taken when it was a holding spot for things before decorating that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/plate-rack-1024x774(pp_w755_h570).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22554" width="755" height="570" alt="plate rack" />I hope you will be back for part 2 to see what it <em>really</em> looks like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you so much for visiting here today.<br />
I am truly blessed that you choose to spend your time with me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Until next time&#8230;</p>

		<p>Kelly, I enjoyed your tour.  Everything is put together in style.<br />
You have given me some ideas.  Can&#8217;t wait to see what you do for Christmas.  Also, did you do your picture framing?  If so, can you tell me how you did it?  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!<br />

<em>Hi Ann!  I did do all the framing of the photos here.  Just use the matted frames from here:  <a href="http://www.aifriedman.com/browse.cfm/mcs-format-museum-collect/2,393.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aifriedman.com/browse.cfm/mcs-format-museum-collect/2,393.html</a><br />
Tape your photos to the back of the mat, and the glass snaps in on top of it.  VERY easy to do. 🙂</p>

		<p>I like the green, brown and white color scheme.  I so love your turkey design plates and that new bench is fun.  Will you be getting another for the other side later?  I have a harvest table made from old barn wood, with Windsor chairs all around, but I also have a bench as well.  I only use it when I have to fit four people on one side.  Oh, I love World Market.  I just recently purchased their cute little pumpkin dishes with lids.  They were on sale for under four dollars each.  Score!  (I have always admired your PB ones)  I think these are a little smaller but not by much.  They had a casserole dish as well, lid and handles.  It made its way into my basket too.  Yes, a happy dance was performed!   Fall Sale&#8230;.Yahoo!  I already have the pumpkin print plates from William Sonoma.  I picked up Crate and Barrel salad plates that have mini pumpkins on them for dessert plates. They were from their Halloween sale.   So, no Tom Turkey plates at my table, though I&#8217;d love to have some&#8230; 🙁 I like that you used some of your old pottery and I can&#8217;t wait to see what you do on the porch!  sigh&#8230;  That word search was a cute idea Kelly.  Will there be a prize for the person who completes the word search first?  🙂<br />

<em>Thank you Debra.  I don&#8217;t think we will be getting a bench for the other side.  We have some guests who don&#8217;t really like to have to maneuver to get on or off of one (elderly.)   I love Windsor chairs!  I bet they look great with your harvest table. 🙂 Sounds like you have done some great shopping lately.  I saw those cute pumpkin plates at Crate and Barrel and contemplated getting them myself.  A prize for the word search winner is a good idea.  How about a turkey leg for the winner? LOL  (No, I will have to think of something better than that.)<br />

		<p>As always, love everything you do.  I did notice the bench, it really finishes things off and makes the table look so inviting and open.  Looking forward to the rest of the tour!<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly,</p>
<p>I love your green and brown theme. It is one of my favorite combinations, especially in the fall. Can&#8217;t believe you change the window treatments. That is special to be able to do that.</p>
<p>I want you to know after reading about your trip to Virginia we decided to follow your footsteps and make a trip to Charlottesville and the Southern Living house. Loved it! Also went to Monticello, as well as the other historic sights. Also ate lunch at Pippin Hill Winery and Michie Tavern. We ate in town in the bricked street, just like being in France! And, checked out John Boy&#8217;s house and museum! Fun! Thank you for the ideas! </p>
<p>I have a turkey platter like yours but have not been able to find a stand that is large enough to hold it. I love your blogs, have learned so much as well as enjoyed how many similarities we seem to have. Thanks so much!</p>
<p>Also, I was thrilled to open a new Christmas magazine and found a story about your house. It couldn&#8217;t be more Christmasy!</p>
<p>Linda<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<em>Thank you Linda!  I am happy you liked the current color combo.  Changing the window treatments is very easy to do.  It is only 2 pairs of drapes.  They already have their rings on them, and it takes only about 15-20 minutes to change them all out.</p>
<p>You did a better job traveling in Virginia than we did!  How fun!!  I&#8217;m so glad you got to visit all those wonderful places. 🙂</p>
<p>The stand that I am using with the platter is this one:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Large-Display-Stand-Clear-White/dp/B001TAPPGO/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1447384757&#038;sr=8-15&#038;keywords=plate+stand" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Large-Display-Stand-Clear-White/dp/B001TAPPGO/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1447384757&#038;sr=8-15&#038;keywords=plate+stand</a> and it is backed all the way up against the wall.  Hope that is what you need. </p>
<p>Thank you for the compliments on the Christmas feature.  I can&#8217;t believe it is almost time to start decorating for it again!<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly &#8230;looks like I&#8217;m a little late to the party today but thanks so much for the invitation! :). Your house always looks amazing but I just love the greens and browns. It seems to change your house &#8230;in a good way! As you say peaceful and just perfect for Thanksgiving. The polished wood and style of your new bench complements your table etc perfectly. Such a great find!  I could keep writing &#8230;your table setting! the Thanksgiving word search! &#8230;your kitchen! Your cookery books!  Just lovely. I&#8217;d be very happy to  perch on that stool or help you in your kitchen &#8230;I like to taste test and snack too!!<br />
We have a lot to be thankful for &#8230;. A lovely bright sunny day here and I&#8217;m looking out at Autumn colours and holly bushes laden with red berries!<br />
Have a good weekend!<br />

<em>Oh, you&#8217;re not late Rosemary!  Just stop in whenever you can.  You must be sitting in my house though, because I am looking out at a lovely bright sunny day here with some autumn colors, and our holly bushes are full of berries as well!  I&#8217;m so glad you like the green and brown in the house.  It IS quite a change from the bright red that normally lives here. 🙂  Come on and taste test and snack with me!  There will be a lot of that going on here next Thursday and Friday as I cook for an upcoming party.<br />
Hope you have a good weekend too.  I hope to have part 2 of the tour up tomorrow, so be sure to stop by again.<br />

		<p>I love the green and brown color scheme for Thanksgiving, which just happens to be my favorite holiday!! 🙂 Love your new bench too. You&#8217;ll be able to use it for extra seating in other areas of your home too if needed. I love the turkey dishes, green pottery and turkey tureen. Now that we are hosting Thanksgiving I need to look for a couple of turkey dishes. Haha, maybe I need to look now to find them on sale! I love your puzzle also. What a great idea. 🙂 I&#8217;m sure in your warmer climate you are still able to flow out onto your porch this time of year. I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll get lucky with warm weather this year for Thanksgiving!!<br />

<em>Well that&#8217;s a lot to love Gina!  You are right about the bench being used in other areas.  I am already thinking it would work great on the porch as well. 🙂  Yes, we can spill out on to the porch and have even during Christmas parties here.  Now is a good time to pick up your turkey plates and things before they are all gone.  So get to shopping!<br />

		<p>I love your thoughts on October being more playful and November more reverent. I noticed the bench right away. Love it! I love benches. I love the colors you went with. I actually went with very similar colors this year for my dining room. I was given some transfer ware and found some beautiful green plates at a resale store that I have in my hutch. I love the soft simple warm colors. Your table looks beautiful. Thanksgiving is coming so fast. Take care, Kelly!<br />

<em>Thanks Patty!  I&#8217;m so glad you liked the colors.  Lucky you to be given some transfer ware!  I have a few bowls in brown transferware and started to mix them in with some green plates here but decided it was just too much pattern for me.  Yes, Thanksgiving will be here soon, but what stresses me out are all the bloggers who are already decorating for Christmas!  I can only handle one holiday at a time. LOL<br />

		<p>Beautiful, beautiful.  I had to chuckle when you stated that you used the  hues of brown and green in displaying the cookbooks to coordinate with the colors in the room&#8230;you certainly pay close attention to every detail.  Love the Thanksgiving word puzzle&#8230;what a great idea!&#8230;.Looking forward to Part 2.<br />

<em>Thank you for your compliments Shirley.  Yes, I go overboard on details, but truthfully, there are not that many to change out in the kitchen.  The white and neutral color ones stay, and I swap out maybe 10 to 15 in total in the kitchen and dining room from the family room bookshelves.  I think the word search spoke to the elementary teacher in me!  I&#8217;m glad you liked the idea!<br />

		<p>Your attention to detail without going overboard is so perfect, Kelly!  Your table is pretty and functional and the little word search game makes it fun.  Love the simple centerpiece.  I don&#8217;t have a lot of space for a large one so I like that you kept yours low and non distracting.  The new bench is awesome!</p>

<em>Aw you are too kind Jane!  I like a low centerpiece so that it can stay on the table and people can see over it.  The pumpkins worked well for that.<br />
Go right ahead and steal the chalkboard recipe idea.  Have fun with it!<br />

I absolutely love the neutrals, greens and browns.  So perfect for this time of year.  Your older green pottery looks antique, how wonderful.  I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it was part of a set.  Love the turkey plates!  It&#8217;s so cool that you have curtains for different seasons and colors.  You have such great style.<br />
The game card is fun.  I may try to re-create it for our dinner.<br />

<em>I&#8217;m so glad you liked the colors, Karen.  All of our pottery was handmade.  My sister in law was a Meaders.  Her family was very influential in the art of folk pottery for many years, and all of our pieces came from either her father, Cleater (CJ) or her uncle, Lanier.  You can read about Lanier here: <a href="http://www.folkpottery.com/lanier/lanier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.folkpottery.com/lanier/lanier.htm</a>  We have a few of Lanier&#8217;s pieces including a couple of face jugs that they mention and show in the article.  A couple of Lanier&#8217;s pieces are on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.<br />
As far as the drapes go, I love fabric too much to be limited to one pair of drapes per window. LOL  And my tastes and moods seem to change with the seasons, so this beats going out and buying all new things every time the seasons change.<br />
I hope you can use the word searches for Thanksgiving.<br />
Enjoy your time with all your family!<br />
Kelly</em></p>

		<p>Kelly,</p>
<p>  Best post ever! I love the browns and greens! Especially the greens. It all looks so nice together. I saw the bench right away. Great addition. I am going use the cute Thanksgiving word search in my classroom for after we discuss what we are thankful for in Religion class the week before Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing. I love your battery operated candle and candle holder on your fridge. Everything ties together so well. I can&#8217;t wait to see the porch. Take care.<br />

<em>Wow what a nice compliment Dawn!  I&#8217;m so happy you liked the post.  Yes, the colors do all work together very well. Please do use the word search in your classroom.  Just remember the words can go in any direction (including backwards!) and they can share letters.<br />

<em>Soothing and calm are quite a change from the bright orange and red of Halloween, aren&#8217;t they Joy? 🙂  I am glad you liked the decorations for this season.   Our candlesticks were all gifts from my mother and my mother in law.  I have no idea where my mother got hers, but it seems that my mother in law purchased hers in an antique shop in Highlands, NC.  I&#8217;m afraid I am not much help other than that on them.  Sorry. 🙁<br />

No Christmas here until after Thanksgiving..unless I decide to put the wreath up in the bedroom.  That would be about as far as I go.

It reminds me of what it&#8217;s really like to celebrate Thanksgiving in the south. The turning leaves with still plenty of green so it doesn&#8217;t look like winter. And I remember the excitement last year when you got your turkey plates! They look great. Love your tablescape. It looks very inviting. I enjoyed this visit. You are a blessing!<br />

<em>Thanks Sherry!  I forgot to mention in the post that when our daughter&#8217;s boyfriend was here at Halloween, we were talking about how I was going to use green and brown for Thanksgiving, and he said, &#8220;Green is not a Thanksgiving color.&#8221;  Well, just like you said, if you live in the South it most certainly is! (And that is what I told him.)  We still have green grass and plenty of green leaves on the trees.  What few turned yellow or red were washed off the tree with the 9 straight days of rain.<br />
As always, thank you for your encouraging comments.<br />

		<p>Another wonderful post.  Did I spot Fairfax flatware?  Love its elegant simplicity.  That was my grandmother&#8217;s pattern, and I&#8217;m the keeper of her silver for this generation.  I admire and enjoy so much your creative and resourceful color scheme changes from season to season.  Another benefit to going brown and green for Thanksgiving is that it will give a rest from red, in preparation for an energizing boost upon the red&#8217;s return at Christmas.   We&#8217;re looking toward a remodel in the coming year or two, and I hope you don&#8217;t mind my purloining your idea of seasonal curtain and drapery change-outs.  Oh, to be handy with needle and thread!  Alas, I&#8217;m a stitchery incompetent, so I&#8217;ll have to farm it out.<br />

<em>Yes, you did spot it Ruth. 🙂  My mother&#8217;s pattern has flowers, and I just liked the simplicity of Fairfax.  How wonderful that the silver stays in your family and you are the keeper of it for now! Your comments about giving a rest from red were exactly what I wanted to say, but I had already been &#8220;wordy&#8221; enough for one post. So thank you for adding them here.  Good luck with your future remodel, and you go right ahead and do any drapery change-out you want. 🙂  Sewing has been a much used skill in my life.  Very glad I learned it&#8230;and typing!<br />

		<p>How tranquil and homey! Amazing how colors can change the room and make it look like a different one. The bench is really a nice touch. I am reading and enjoying your post on a lovely fall afternoon while I recoup from my wonderful<br />
trip to The Big Peach City! How many Peach tree Streets are there anyway?:) I&#8217;m inspired to start pulling my holiday together&#8212; at the beach&#8211; a first! Going to let Publix do most of my cooking this year ( another first!) since I have a micro kitchen there. But will do my baking and appetizers and decorations. Planning on 12 and think dessert will be enjoyed on the beach&#8211;picnic style if weather is still this nice. How many are you expecting? And hope you share some more of your family recipes!! &#8221; Over the River and through the Woods!&#8221; My favorite holiday! 🙂<br />

<em>Tranquil..that&#8217;s what I was shooting for. 🙂  Glad you made it back safely from Hot &#8216;lanta.  I have no idea how many Peachtree streets there are, but there are a LOT of them!  The big question is&#8230;where did you eat on your trip???  Inquiring minds want to know!<br />
Glad you are inspired.  Thanksgiving at the beach would be different&#8230;but enjoyed by everyone I am sure.  Nice to let someone else do the cooking.  We don&#8217;t have a number yet&#8230;still waiting to see what the plans are for everyone.  No problem though.<br />

<p>Rain rain go away!  I&#8217;m expecting Noah and his ark to show up any time now.  It rained here on and off <em>all</em> last week with a break during the day on Saturday.  Then it started again Saturday night and has not stopped.  Rain for a day or so? That is perfectly fine and cozy, but this kind of rain? It is depressing.  <em>I do not like dark and dreary</em>. 🙁 (And there is no way to take photos for the blog when it is this dark.)</p>
<p>I tried to write a<em> Talk of the Weekend</em> post for you yesterday, but it just wouldn&#8217;t come together. (I needed the photo above which I could not take in the dark.)  So I have changed it to a <em>Monday Morning Mention</em> instead.  Let&#8217;s start with a bright and cheery house. 🙂  Do you remember Anthony Baratta and his over-the-top love of color and pattern?  (I featured some of the homes he did with William Diamond <a href="../../farmhouse-week-day-2-rooms-full-of-color-and-the-giveaway-continues/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He did this particular kitchen, and it <em>really</em> caught my eye&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Anthony-Barrata-kitchen-with-red-gingham-ceiling.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22497" width="647" height="900" alt="Anthony Barrata kitchen with red gingham ceiling" /><a href="http://www.anthonybaratta.com/projects/new-canaan-country/" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Red gingham ceiling, white cabinetry, red countertops, and a very colorful painted floor. Here is another view of it:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/kitchen-with-red-gingham-ceiling(pp_w755_h469).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22498" width="755" height="469" alt="kitchen with red gingham ceiling" /><em><a href="http://www.housekaboodle.com/cape-cod-mansion-diamond-baratta-design/" target="_blank">source</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do you think it is too much for your eyes?  The house is located in New Canaan, Connecticut, and it has been on the market for a while.  I wanted you to take a look at what they have done to the kitchen since it has been for sale.  I am wondering if they toned it down in order to appeal to more buyers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/updated-kitchen(pp_w755_h500).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22499" width="755" height="500" alt="updated kitchen" /><em><a href="http://www.weichert.com/57716420/" target="_blank">source</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quite a change&#8230;right?  Which version do you prefer?  I actually like the new floors better, but I could have lived with the red gingham ceiling..although when you put that much red adjacent to white, it often gives the white a tint of pink.  The price for the home is a little under $9,000,000 just in case you are interested in purchasing it. 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While we are on the subject of red, have you seen <a href="http://sugarpaper.com/blogs/news/52873217-sugar-paper-x-target-holiday-is-here" target="_blank">Sugar Paper&#8217;s</a> new line of holiday gift wrap at <a href="http://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=sugar+paper+holiday&amp;category=0%7CAll%7Cmatchallpartial%7Call+categories&amp;lnk=snav_sbox_sugar+paper+holiday" target="_blank">Target</a>?  It comes in 4 different colorways, and it has some great touches of gold on many pieces &#8211; including the gift boxes.  <em>Yes, you can purchase the gift boxes!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sugar-Paper-Christmas-paper-for-Target-1024x512(pp_w755_h377).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22500" width="755" height="377" alt="Sugar Paper Christmas paper for Target" /><em><a href="https://corporate.target.com/article/2015/11/sugar-paper" target="_blank">source </a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was soooo excited to learn that our local store would be carrying it!  My husband and I were in Target on Friday night.  I rushed to the Christmas corner, and there it was in all its prettiness.  I put 2 rolls of gift wrap, a package of tags, and a spool of ribbon in my cart, but after studying the paper items a bit, I realized the red would not go with the reds in our home. They were a little too coral in tone, so they went back on the shelf. 🙁  But all is not lost&#8230;have you checked out the holiday goodies at Bullseye&#8217;s Playground (formerly the Dollar Spot)?  It was filled with cute chalkboards, jars, and buffalo check items &#8211; all mostly under $3!  The checked plates had to jump in my shopping cart for some reason. 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Target-shopping.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22513" width="680" height="750" alt="Target shopping" /><em><a href="http://www.allthingstarget.com/target-dollar-spot-bullseyes-playground/" target="_blank">source</a></em></p>
<p>Okay&#8230;enough shopping.  Let&#8217;s talk about houses for a minute. 🙂  Last week many of you, like me,  seemed to adore the rustic cabins we were perusing.  Have you seen the ones at<a href="http://www.balsammountainpreserve.com/" target="_blank"> Balsam Mountain Preserve</a>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Balsam-Mountain-Preserve-cabins(pp_w755_h499).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22503" width="755" height="499" alt="Balsam Mountain Preserve cabins" /><em><a href="http://www.historicalconcepts.com/communities/resorts-hospitality/balsam" target="_blank">source</a></em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Isn&#8217;t this gathering room at the Boarding House there a beautiful space?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Balsam-Mountain-Preserve-Boarding-House-gathering-room-1024x681(pp_w755_h502).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22506" width="755" height="502" alt="Balsam Mountain Preserve Boarding House gathering room" /><em><a href="http://www.historicalconcepts.com/communities/resorts-hospitality/balsam" target="_blank">source</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or perhaps you would prefer a cozy Cotswold cottage.  Here is a precious one by Thurston/Boyd Interior Design. Is it just me, or does it remind you of Iris&#8217;cottage in <em>The Holiday</em>? (Or do all Cotswold cottages now remind you of that movie?)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cotswald-Cottage-Thurston-Boyd(pp_w755_h499).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22507" width="755" height="499" alt="Cotswald Cottage Thurston Boyd" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://www.thurstonboyd.com/about.html" target="_blank">source</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And finally let&#8217;s go from a small and cozy cottage to a large but charming kitchen.<br />
This one is full of wonderful details&#8230;from the walls to the copper in that cabinet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bhg-kitchen.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22508" width="550" height="733" alt="bhg kitchen" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don&#8217;t forget to click on the sources below the photos to see more of each space.</em></p>
<p>And now to catch up.  I turned the computer off for most of last week &#8211; no blog posts, no emails, nothing. I was trying to get things ready for a big all weekend party we were supposed to have here this past weekend.  Unfortunately, a couple of our out-of-town guests had to cancel&#8230; so no party occurred.  (We are rescheduling it though.)</p>
<p>Then I worked the rest of the week nonstop getting the house Thanksgiving ready since we are the back-up location for a big family reunion on that day if my in-laws are unable to host it.  (Fingers crossed and prayers that my father in law keeps making progress. )  Sooo, if it will ever stop raining, I have <em>a lot</em> of November decorating to show you&#8230;<em>and</em> there is no red in any of it.  (Did you faint? 🙂 ) I will be catching up on all your emails today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>And on this rainy Monday, in the month of giving thanks, my thankful heart is grateful for many things, but most especially for your visits and comments here.  I appreciate all of your encouragement as we talk of houses, decorating, entertaining, and all sorts of other random things. 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Happy Monday!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Until next time&#8230;<br />

		<p>Yet another thing we have in common, log houses or cabins!  I recently got the DIY channel and I am hooked on Barnwood Builders&#8230;love the program and all the crew.<br />
I like the remodeled red kitchen, the first one was way to busy for me. Fun to visit but I wouldn&#8217;t want to live there.<br />
We finally saw the sun on Tuesday in North Carolina, you are so right first couple of days of rain were cozy, but it got old fast.<br />
As always thanks for sharing, Cindy<br />

<em>We almost bought a log cabin years ago, but the sellers would not take a contingency sale contract.  Everything worked out for the best for us, but I still love old cabins.<br />
Yes, that rain got old&#8230;and dark&#8230;and depressing.  I know you were just as happy as I was to see that sunshine this week!<br />

<em>I do love all that red, and like you, perhaps changing the floor would do it. Just couldn&#8217;t handle both a patterned ceiling AND floor.  You should like Baratta&#8217;s work since he uses so much red.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t made a Christmas list yet.  Just got our daughter&#8217;s and oldest son&#8217;s WISH LISTS for Christmas an hour ago.  Can&#8217;t start the Christmas list here until we get through a major big party next week and then Thanksgiving. (But I HAVE been thinking about it.)</p>

		<p>Well, before I forget, I LOVE the Cotswolds cottage!  I could move right in  🙂  That&#8217;s the look I aim for in our townhome.  We have large windows, wood floors, maple cabinetry in the open kitchen and granite countertops &#8211; brushed nickel appliances.  Pretty higher end of the spectrum cookie cutter for this area, but I love the openness, good square footage and lot of light.  The neutral color palette lends itself to a wide range of decorating options.  Honestly, pretty much our tastes are the same.  Which is why I scooted to Target to check out the Bullseye Zone &#8211; and we had fun! So much was already gone, but I did manage to get a stand up green Tree chalkboard, glass jar with red stockingette pattern and twine, adorable small white reindeer lights (battery operated and last string left!) and string of just what I was hunting &#8211; mini twine clothesline with red clothespins &#8211; perfect for displaying Christmas cards.  It certainly is the little treasures on a rainy day!<br />
I also want to say that the wreath on your front door is gorgeous!!!  I could go on and on, lol, but want to wish you and your family a very blessed Thanksgiving!  Thanks for all you put into your blog for us to enjoy!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<em>I think everyone here wants to live in a Cotswold cottage! LOL  Sounds like you did great at Target!  I had my eye on those red clothespins with the twine too.  (I should have gotten them before everything was picked over.)  That stuff went fast!  Thank you for the compliment on the wreath.  I think it is a bit too small for the space, but it is serving a dual purpose that I will share in a couple of weeks. Stay tuned.<br />
Blessed Thanksgiving wishes to you too.  Your comments are always a blessing to me Mari. 🙂<br />

		<p>Baratta has made quite a name for himself and is interesting to look<br />

		<p>First I want to say that I read your blog all the time but rarely leave comments, I can sort of feel out those who do a lot of thought and work on their posts and time is short just living life, especially with kids.  But I have to smile because we are so alike&#8211;I get to rambling about life and everyday events in general, too.  And Target&#8230;the same thing happened to me last week.  Right now I&#8217;m seeing a lot of red, plaids and buffalo checks.  I did find a throw that was a little subdued and since it was marked down I grabbed it.  Have you noticed in the past few years that colors go from bright red across the spectrum to blingy silver?  No biggie. Just hard to find what I really want.  Was at Marshall&#8217;s today and swore I needed nothing else.  Gulp.  But still had a great savings.</p>
<p>These homes are gorgeous.  We have a second home in the country and it really resembles the sort of rustic homes you shared.  We&#8217;re in the middle of making huge changes in every room and I saw so many details I can add to our plans.  Thanks for the links.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!!  I&#8217;d love for you to stop by! 🙂</p>

<em>Yes, time is certainly short!  It is hard to get blog posts out, respond to comments, and do everything that non-blogging life requires AND manage to read other blogs and leave comments.  And then YOU go and write for a newspaper on top of all of that?  Good grief!  I too am seeing all the red and plaids and buffalo checks everywhere.  It is just too much for me.  My first thought when buying things is&#8230;.where will I store this when I am not using it?  That determines whether or not I will buy something.  Space is not in big supply around here.  How fun to shop at Marshalls!  They always have such great bargains!</p>
<p>Good luck with the projects in your second home!  If we had one of those I would have no problem finding space for things! LOL<br />

		<p>Yes, I&#8217;m getting pretty tired of rain where I live also!! I really enjoyed all the great photos you shared on your post today. I love the Cotswald Cottage! How beautiful and cozy looking. I believe I like the Conneticut house kitchen redo better than the original. The white walls and ceiling and the wood floors just have a calm look compared to all of the color that was in there before. Although, the previous kitchen style was pretty. I look forward to seeing your Thanksgiving decorations. Prayers for your father-in-law to keep improving!!<br />

<em>Thank you for your prayers Debbie.  He has some good nurses helping him, and he is getting stronger (and more mobile) daily. 🙂  We had sunny skies return around 4:00 today, and tomorrow is to be pretty. Hope you have the same.  I think all of us need a Cotswold cottage &#8211; either for a home or for a vacation.  Thanksgiving decorating coming this week.<br />

		<p>Oops&#8230; The main thing I wanted to tell you and I forgot&#8230; You have got to look at the gift tags Emily A Clarke showed on her last blog post! You will go a Little CRAZY over them!

		<p>Rain, rain go away, all us girls just want to play! I think we will be looking for an ark in Brevard soon! Thankfully, Veteran&#8217;s Day&#8217;s forecast looks good!<br />
I definitely liked the &#8220;after&#8221; kitchen better than the before.<br />
I just love that Sugar Paper line at Target. I had one of the cute day planners in my cart on Sunday for my niece  but then  realized that teenagers keep their schedules electronically most likely.<br />
I just love your pictures from Balsam Preserve. The year my husband retired we had his office Christmas party at the Boarding House. I took some beautiful pictures from the porch of the gorgeous mountain range. We had a fire roaring that day just like the fire in the picture. That party is a fun memory.<br />
I sure hope your father in law is on the mend!<br />
As Thanksgiving approaches I want you to know that I am thankful for the inspiration you bring to me each time you have a blog post!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Sunny afternoon late here today, and a sunny day is in store for all of tomorrow (then clouds again on Thursday. 🙁 )  Hope your Veteran&#8217;s Day forecast stayed sunny.<br />
I did buy the planner and the desk calendar while I was in Target.  You are right about electronic scheduling for the younger crowd&#8230;although my daughter still likes an old fashioned desk calendar as well.<br />
I cannot believe you attended a Christmas party at the Boarding House!!! How wonderful would that be!!<br />
Thank you for your sweet words about the blog.  I am thankful for you!<br />

		<p>Kelly,<br />
I&#8217;m sorry for your over-abundance of rain.  We got a few drops today and did our happy dance. </p>
<p>I love rustic!  I also love Thurston/Boyd&#8230;Randy Boyd is a California designer and his home in Laguna Beach is one of my all time favorite houses.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t live with that first kitchen.  I love red but that kitchen was too busy for my taste.  Better toned down, still not sure I&#8217;d want red counter tops.<br />
We&#8217;re in full Thanksgiving mode here.  I love this holiday.<br />
xo,<br />

<em>I wish there was some way I could send you some of our rain.  We have had so much that there are flood warnings here for the local rivers&#8230;.just way too much.<br />
Randy Boyd is so talented.  I love how he mixes old antiques in new settings, and they make for a very comfortable but stylish room.  I know you have featured Thurston/Boyd in a blog post or two.<br />
I agree that the kitchen was way too busy.  Even as much as I love red, I would not want to be limited in color schemes by red counters.  But they are mighty brave!<br />
We are ready for Thanksgiving too&#8230;.first time ever being ready this early!<br />

		<p>You&#8217;ve had too much rain and we have been desperately needing it. Fortunately for us it started raining Sunday evening and has rained off and on today. Maybe yours moved on down to Florida! You always share the most gorgeous homes! That gingham ceiling is really neat, but I prefer the made over version overall. The other kitchen was too limiting for decorating for the holidays. Speaking of&#8230;.I can&#8217;t wait to see yours! Have a lovely and hopefully dry week!<br />

		<p>I am in your state/capital and it was a lovely flight on Friday. But then the rain started &#8212; so I had to quickly enjoy the color of the leaves. Traffic was horrendous from the airport to downtown. Enjoyed the Atlanta History Center-farm and Swan House, Coke Tour and Aquarium. Tomorrow going to Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s home. So as you can see I have been looking at lovely homes. Was thinking about your Saturday event&#8211; sorry the rain delayed it. Also went to a book signing and met Judy Blume!! Temperature here 40&#8217;s &#8211; Orlando 80&#8217;s! Mercy&#8211; this FL gal is chilled!!:) loved your post and looking forward to seeing Harvest decorations at your home. Have you had your fireplace logs burning? Relax and enjoy the coolness!! Going home Wednesday &#8212; still very warm there!! 2 weeks until Thanksgiving! Can&#8217;t believe it&#8211; going by too fast for me!<br />

<em>I saw all your photos on Facebook Louvina.  You are doing the city tour right!  (Except for the horrible traffic which is always horrible.)  Can&#8217;t believe you met the famous Judy Blume!  WOW!<br />
It has been a little chilly here, and we have had one fire in the fireplace (and I have worn boots and sweatshirts this week here to keep warm!)<br />
Hope you have a safe flight home to your warm state.<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly:  I, too, am just depleted with rain and dreary days.  Marvel at how people can get anything done, but it is good for a good book by the fire. Love anything Cotswold, British, Masterpiece Theatre, scones, cooking competitions (recent British Bakeoff), and lest I forget, The Royals.  Sunday night is a favorite TV night, me and PBS.  So, I&#8217;ve tried to watch The Holiday on more than one occasion, but don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve watched it through.  Will give it another chance though.  Looking forward to sunny days and your Thanksgiving decorations.  Glad to see that your daughter recovered and wishing the same for your FIL.<br />

<em>It certainly makes you feel like doing nothing (except napping!)  Can&#8217;t believe you haven&#8217;t seen all of The Holiday.  Do watch it all the way through.  The ending is especially sweet. 🙂<br />
Thank you for the good wishes for my FIL.<br />
We have a sunny day on tap for today.  Hooray! (Hope you do too. 🙂 )<br />

		<p>Target is definitely my &#8220;go to&#8221; place for all things in Christmas decor this year.  They have so many lovely items and such reasonable prices.  Their dollar bin in the front of the store has quickly become my favorite spot for gathering items for craft projects!<br />

		<p>I like &#8220;Monday Morning Mentions.&#8221; 🙂 I love to take a break from the Internet, social media, etc. occasionally. I love all the pretty images in the post. Wow! That first kitchen would be perfect for the 4th of July. I like the updated version better. Love the copper in the last kitchen too. I had been seeing it show up around the Internet so I drug a few pieces out of my attic and put out for fall. I love how it looks. I&#8217;m getting my house ready for Thanksgiving too. We&#8217;re hosting for the second year since my grandparents aren&#8217;t able to anymore. I have some deep housecleaning this week. Thank goodness the rain has stopped now and it has lightened up. It&#8217;s hard to get motivated with a dark house. 🙂<br />

<em>Thank you Gina.  I am glad you liked it.  You are so right about the difficulty of getting motivated to clean when it is so dark.  Thankfully, the sun has come out today, and I am going to get busy as well.  Lucky you to have pieces of copper to decorate with!  We had copper cookware the first few years of our marriage, but those pots and pans have managed to make their way into our children&#8217;s college apartments&#8230;all except for one little pot that I insisted we hang on to.<br />
Have a great Veteran&#8217;s Day!<br />

		<p>Funny you should feature the cabins and Dining Hall at Balsam today!  I was just thinking how nice it would be to be sitting in front of that big fireplace right about now.  Thanks for sharing these with your readers.</p>

		<p>We retired from teaching, sold our house in MS, and have been living in Idaho for  the last three years.  Just decided to try it!  It&#8217;s a great place to live, but It hardly ever rains here, and I so miss the downpours.  If it drizzles here, people call it a big rainfall. We are high desert in climate.   I can just smell the misty, musty smell of Southern rain!  I never thought about the rain too much until I didn&#8217;t have it. </p>
<p>We are renting here because I miss the South and our children, so we will need to purchase a home at some point, probably back in the South.  I have gotten used to a much smaller home, and I actually like it. I would want  more storage space.  The Cotswold cottage looks so inviting and could be the  perfect home for someone who wants to downsize.  </p>
<p>Thank you, Kelly, for introducing us to homes and interior designers we would never know of if not for you!  I am so looking forward to seeing your home decorated for Thanksgiving. I always borrow some of your ideas, and you have encouraged me to add seasonal touches to our home, which I had pretty much stopped doing since our children have grown up and left home.  You have helped me see that seasonal touches lift our spirits and provide a welcoming home to friends. Thank you!<br />

<em>I do like a rain every now and then, but 9 days of it in a row has been a bit much!  I would miss it though if I had to do without it like you.<br />
Downsizing is in our future too (I hope.)  Smaller, but with storage.  I hope that is possible!<br />
I am so glad you can find ideas here. Good for you for adding in the seasonal touches to your home!  They do add much to our homes.<br />

		<p>Rain, go away!  It poured all night as well as blew (we really get the wind up here on the mountain) and I was thinking our log cabin would make a pretty good ark.  Off and on (mostly on) rain today.  Of course I love the rustic cabins at Balsam Preserve, but in my heart I&#8217;m a Cotswold Cottage girl.  Would love the cottage in &#8220;The Holiday&#8221; and I&#8217;m still disappointed it&#8217;s not real.  The one you show would do just fine.  </p>
<p>As for the Anthony Baratta kitchen &#8211; well, I&#8217;m not a red person (sorry!). Love the tile behind the stove, and I really like the floor pattern.  But I guess if it came down to it, I&#8217;d take a natural wood floor. I always have to have some natural elements and everything else is painted or colorful.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>Rain rain is supposed to be gone today, but the FOG won&#8217;t leave for some reason.  I, too, am disappointed that the Cotswold cottage in the movie was only a set..but it WAS a good imitation!<br />
I think the new floor in that kitchen is very pretty.<br />
Hope your cabin has made it through all the rain, and that there is a sunny day ahead for you Carolyn. 🙂<br />

		<p>Absolutely delightful posting as always. I LOVE the Cotswold cottage the best. I could watch &#8220;The Holiday&#8221; once a week, and though I love the California house, my heart leaps at Iris&#8217;s cottage and the photo you shared of the Cotswold cottage is breathtaking. </p>
<p>Hope your father-in-law continues to improve, but glad you&#8217;ve offered your beautiful home as backup for the family reunion/Thanksgiving gathering. </p>
<p>I really agree that the floors of the Connecticut house are much improved and understand completely the sellers&#8217; having to make these changes. For nine million dollars, I&#8217;d think they would have to compromise some of that great decorating. I could live with the gingham ceilings without the painted floor, though. I see what you mean about the &#8220;pink&#8221; cast that red and white sometimes creates.</p>
<p>Love hearing from you! You definitely hold a place of high importance in my &#8220;inbox.&#8221; </p>
<p>Thanksgiving blessings! And I do hope the rain stops!<br />

<em>Goodness thank you for your sweet comment Mary Ellen!  I thought that Cotswold cottage was just sooo charming.  And thank you for the well wishes for my father in law.  He is getting stronger with each day.<br />
The sun is supposed to be out today, but we currently cannot see it through all the fog.  Waiting on it to lift.<br />
Thanksgiving blessings to you and your family too! 🙂<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly, good to hear from you! I really had to look at these pictures a few times and think carefully! I really love the Gathering Room at the Boarding house, the Cotswold Kitchen and the neutral version of the Connecticut house &#8230; I have either tiled or oak floors throughout my house and its very much my sort of kitchen. However, there&#8217;s something rather brave and spectacular about the RED kitchen. Although I think I would have to choose between the painted floors and the gingham ceiling. I think both is a bit too much! It brings to mind the colours of a 50&#8217;s style American Diner. Or how I imagine one! I think secretly I would enjoy a kitchen like this 🙂<br />
Although not lucky enough to own a Cotswold style cottage, as I live not far from the area I do get to visit quite regularly and have coffee or lunch at a beautiful hotel/Inn that has lovely cosy rooms with Inglenook Fireplaces and real log fires. My favourite pastime is sitting for a while by the fire with a coffee or glass of wine &#8230; just perfect! Even better, for my birthday, knowing how much I love it, my children have planned a surprise stay there for my husband and I. Sooo looking forward to it. I was quite emotional when they gave me the gift card they&#8217;d designed telling me what my present was.<br />
I hope you have a good week and your father in law&#8217;s health continues to improve.<br />
Rosemary<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>What a fantastic and thoughtful gift from your children!  I absolutely love it.  Tell them they did great! (I am sure you already have.)  Yes, sitting by a fire in a beautiful hotel with a cup of coffee would be the ultimate relaxation for me (and anyone else too.)  I know you will enjoy that gift.<br />
Thank you for the wishes for the week and for my father in law.<br />
Hope your week is going well too.<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly, I&#8217;ve loved William Diamond and Anthony Baratta since the first time I saw a house they did for Christmas!

<em>Is the house that you saved the photos of the one with a playroom that had playing cards on the Christmas tree?  I loved that one years and years ago.  I should have saved the photos from that one (long before blogs ever existed.)<br />

		<p>Kelly I prefer a Cotswold Cottage! Do you know where I can buy one cheap?:) I was watching The Holiday on tv the other night and drooling over Iris&#8217;s cottage in Surrey.  I enjoy Amanda&#8217;s beautiful California house too but give me that cozy cottage.  </p>
