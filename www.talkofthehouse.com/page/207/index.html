<p style="text-align: left;">Our students have been back in school here for almost a month now, but for most of the country, school does not begin until after Labor Day.  So I have been saving this post until Labor Day was on the horizon.  It is <em>unreal</em> how many of you are teachers or retired teachers!  So this post is for all you educators. (But the rest of you are more than welcome to continue reading! :))</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.juliausher.com/kitchen_and_studio/more/back_to_school_bonanza" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/08/back-to-school-party.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11860" width="505" height="582" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.juliausher.com/kitchen_and_studio/more/back_to_school_bonanza" target="_blank"><em>source</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you were following Talk of the House last spring, you learned that I have been an elementary teacher with a homeroom for all 31 years of my teaching career.  And it&#8217;s no secret that I am a workaholic (like many teachers) whose normal school day includes an excessive number of after-school and on-the-weekend hours.  There have been numerous changes in education in the last three decades.  The demands placed on regular ed teachers in our county (and probably elsewhere) have become practically humanly impossible to meet &#8211; including some additional ones that were put in place for this year.</p>

<p>It was because of <em>all</em> of this that I asked my administration to move me to a math teaching position that became available at the end of last school year.  And let me tell you, this is the best thing I could have <em>ever</em> done!  I am soooooo loving it.  One of my friends said that I &#8220;have a new lease on life.&#8221;  Another one commented to me the other day, &#8220;It is like you have dancing shoes on all the time now.&#8221; 🙂  Pretty good, huh?  Moving into this position required that I change classrooms, and I want to  show you where this math girl now resides, but first let me show you my old third grade room again that I had last year.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Now this was my <em>new</em> room when I moved into it in June.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/new-room-before(pp_w717_h478).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11866" width="717" height="478" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had never seen so many math manipulatives and school supplies before!  It took six days during my summer break working in there to organize it all.  (I am so thrilled to have this job, I would have spent every day of the summer to get it ready if I had needed to!)  So here is the door to my new classroom&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Our entire hall has silhouettes of children down it that we all made from bulletin board paper.)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1-a-math-room(pp_w746_h484).jpg" class="pp-insert-all  aligncenter" width="746" height="484" alt="" />I obviously recycled much of my classroom decor.<img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2-a-math-room(pp_w746_h430).jpg" class="pp-insert-all  aligncenter" width="746" height="430" alt="" /></p>
<p>The &#8220;fake&#8221; chalkboards are large chart tablet boxes that are covered with black bulletin board paper.  I rubbed chalk all over them to give them an &#8220;older&#8221; effect before writing on them.<img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3-a-math-room(pp_w746_h474).jpg" class="pp-insert-all  aligncenter" width="746" height="474" alt="" /><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/4-a-math-room(pp_w746_h502).jpg" class="pp-insert-all  aligncenter" width="746" height="502" alt="" />The cabinets are now filled with math manipulatives organized by topic (decimals, fractions, geometry, etc.)<img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-a-math-room(pp_w709_h554).jpg" class="pp-insert-all  aligncenter" width="709" height="554" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The big books are old outdated law books that I covered in paper and gave imaginary math titles.<img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6-a-math-room(pp_w729_h488).jpg" class="pp-insert-all  aligncenter" width="729" height="488" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that concludes our classroom tour.  Since we are on a back-to-school post, I wanted to show you our daughter&#8217;s dorm room today, too.  (You are such fast learners you just graduated from elementary school and are now heading to college! :))</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/college.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11859" width="512" height="768" alt="" />Keep in mind that these are <em>her</em> decorating ideas and her color choices.  She and her roommate decided on everything.  The only things I did were:  put ribbon on the lamp shade, make the ribbon hangers on the letter and bulletin board, and spray paint the wicker trunks (and pay for things!)  She did the photo collages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/college-dorm-photos-1(pp_w746_h503).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11877" width="746" height="503" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here is her desk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/college-desk-628x1024.jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11878" width="628" height="1024" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Her roommate was trying to study when I interrupted her to take photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Sorry Missy!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/college-roommate-1.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11879" width="550" height="768" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And here is our daughter wearing pink that matches their room decor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/college-dorm-room-1(pp_w746_h496).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11880" width="746" height="496" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So now you have been to an elementary school and college in today&#8217;s post.   Since we are celebrating all things back-to school, it is time for your test question from this teacher:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What was your best/favorite subject in school? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Mine was math!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/7-a-math-room.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11891" width="512" height="768" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Looking forward to your answers!<img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/08/a-signature10.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11892" width="58" height="51" alt="" /></p>

		<p>I follow you on Pinterest and didn&#8217;t realize you were a teacher!I too, was a full-time teacher for many years. Until I too, took a (part-time) position as a Math teacher! Like you&#8230;I am so much happier! And also&#8230;like you&#8230;one of my favorite parts of the year is decorating my classroom. Your classroom is gorgeous! What a comfortable learning space you have made for those lucky children. I absolutely love your style! Thank you for sharing!:)</p>

		<p>Love your daughters dorm room.  Wish mine had looked like that.  Love the green trunks, could you tell mr where you bought them.  I could use some nice looking storage containers.  Thanks and keep up the good stuff coming!  Love when I see you have a new post.<br />

I am also a teacher and I really enjoy your blog. I love your classroom! I wish I had the energy to really decorate like that. I know your students love to be in there. What do you do in the area where the wicker love seat is placed? Everything is just darling.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>Jennifer, the loveseat was in my third grade room in the reading center where children could sit to read books.  I did not want to take it home since the garage is so full of our boys&#8217; junk right now, and I don&#8217;t want to get rid of it in a yard sale.  So I have a small reading center in this math room too&#8230;for children to sit and read if/when they finish their work.  It is comfortable!  I hope your school year is off to a great start!<br />

		<p>WHAT a CUTE CUTE room. Any child would love being in your classroom.  Where did you get your cute silhouettes and large numbers? Did you make them?  </p>
<p>I helped my son a little bit with his classroom the other day. He teaches 7th grade History. He doesn&#8217;t have patience with all my cute ideas for his classroom, LOL. That is a guy teacher for you!</p>

For the silhouettes we googled silhouettes of children and chose images from there to enlarge using some of the technology in our classroom.  Then traced them on black bulletin board paper and cut them out.  I used the ones from here:  <a href="http://www.charactersf.com/clients/pottery-barn-kids/brand-identity" rel="nofollow">http://www.charactersf.com/clients/pottery-barn-kids/brand-identity</a> I have always loved PBKids branding, so they were perfect for this.<br />

		<p>Honestly, we moved around 3 times in my first 3 years of school, so I missed some things and was always behind. I never really liked school because of that. I have to say my favorite subject in middle and high school was Home Ec. I loved learning about baking and setting tables, sewing and crafting. I still love these things. I became a teacher, but if I could do it all again I would major in Home Ec (aka Family and Consumer Science)That&#8217;s one reason I love your blog so much!!!<br />

		<p>Your room looks so happy and inviting&#8230;.I think I might have liked math in that room, but only because it satisfied my love of beauty. All the work you did to make it pretty and organized is wonderful&#8230;. I loved reading/literature, really didn&#8217;t enjoy math at all. I am still sort of in awe of people that do love it, my brain shuts down when I see math problems.</p>
<p>Your daughter&#8217;s dorm room looks great. It is a challenge to make those little rooms liveable and attractive. She did a great job!</p>
<p>Here in NC we start back to school in mid to late Aug. I love all the back to school sales and still get excited over new school supplies, ahh the smell of new crayons&#8230; blank notebooks to fill , pencils with working erasers,it never gets old to me. My 3 oldest granddaughters are in school,2 just started kindergarten so they are super excited about everything related to school. They even think homework is wonderful. I am glad to hear you are loving your new position, hope this is a great year for you.<br />

		<p>Hi Kelley,</p>
<p>I too am a teacher.  I have taught for 32 years and this will be my last year.  I too agree that there are many demands made on the teachers of our country.  I have taught in a middle school now for 21 years.  Even though I am looking forward to retirement I know it will be bittersweet to leave my classroom.</p>

<em>Like you Bobbie, I too am looking forward to retirement (but I will probably have a couple more years.)  I keep wondering when education is going to swing in a different direction. And I am afraid we are running all the good teachers out of the profession. Yes, it will be bittersweet to leave teaching, but I think the change will be a good one. Hope yours will be too.<br />

		<p>Love, love, love your classroom and especially the silhouettes!!<br />
Math is my least favorite subject so I would have been the little kiddo who came to your fabulous classroom for extra help!<br />
Your daughter&#8217;s dorm room is so, so pretty and she looks just like her pretty mom&#8230;lucky girl! You and she would enjoy the post that Shannon Berrey did on her freshman daughter&#8217;s dorm room at NC State (more chevron)&#8230;just go to Shannon Berry.com.<br />
My favorite subject&#8230;&#8230;..language arts&#8230;I used to LOVE to diagram me some sentences!!!!<br />

<em>A sentence diagrammer, huh?  I remember doing that many many years ago in the dark ages. 🙂  I wonder if they still do that in middle school?  I will have to go check out Shannon&#8217;s post.  We looked at NC state for our daughter, but she really wanted Chapel Hill..but did not get in there.  Boo hoo.  Maybe she can get in for grad school there.

		<p>What a great classroom, I&#8217;m sure it reflects all the energy you put into the teaching of your subject. Hope daughter has a wonderful year at school, she is so darn pretty! (Love the dorm colors, tres Lily!) My favorite subject always was English, with the electives following: Music, Home Ec. etc.! However, in college I switched from English to History and found my true fit. After teaching for thirty two years, I have been subbing and taking part time jobs for the past five years &#8211; I don&#8217;t know where the time has gone.

		<p>Oh my, your classrooms ( both old and new) are amazing! So many great ideas and neat things to see. Where I teach we are not allowed to have any wall covered with paper/posters more than 20%. I can near you gasping now, lol.  At first it was hard but I&#8217;m used to it now. We are back to school on Tuesday and our students return September 5th. Thanks for sharing those wonderful photos. Your blog is one of two that I check daily and I am never disappointed. 🙂<br />

<em>Thank you for following along with all the posts, Beth!  I am glad you can find ideas to use here.  We had some &#8220;paper on the walls&#8221; rules awhile back.  They said it was because of &#8220;fire code&#8221;, but oddly enough after searching through many fire codes I could not find one thing that mentioned it.  Maybe it was more of an &#8220;insurance company&#8221; code?  Our building is not allowed to put anything directly on the door, and we have an 80% covered max rule for the walls.  I brought up using the fire resistant bulletin board paper, (but I still have fabric on my bulletin boards.)  They said the fire resistant paper could be used in any proportion (but it does cost a lot.)<br />

		<p>Your classroom is delightful.  I&#8217;m sure you are an amazing teacher with lucky students.  Good luck on the new math gig.  Why does your school start a month early?  I am showing my stupidity here &#8211; but I thought all schools started the Tuesday after Labor Day.  Is there a reason to start it in August?  </p>
<p>No one understands how much extra time teachers put in&#8230; name another profession where people would use up 6 days of their vacation time &#8211; WORKING &#8211; at their job (which is what you did).  Amazing.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>Elle, I have wondered about our start time over and over again.  It has something to do with finishing all the end of semester tests in our local high schools before Christmas.  (We do have a week off in October and a week in November.)  Amen about teachers putting in extra hours&#8230;and doing it for no pay.  It is a &#8220;crying shame&#8221; to me&#8230;and it is sort of expected here.  They &#8220;ask&#8221; a large number of teachers to attend an all day meeting the day summer vacation begins &#8211; for no pay &#8211; and I just think that is wrong. Many people mistakenly think teachers get &#8220;paid&#8221; for the summer.  The truth is, we have already earned that money, and the county gets to keep it until they distribute it back to us in the summer.  Thank you for speaking up for teachers.<br />

		<p>Kelly, your classroom looks amazing, how I wish I had a math teacher like you. I struggled with math. My favorite class was art, I went on to get a BFA in art and taught elementary art in Ohio for 4 years. We moved to PA where for the last 34 years I have been teaching preschoolers, it has been amazing to watch this age be so creative. I do enjoy the young ones and we just had orientation today and again tomorrow, I am looking forward to the new school year.  Thank you for sharing your classroom. Mickey<br />

		<p>In college Art Appreciation was my favorite class.  In high school biology was my favorite.  Your classrooms look so great! Your sense of style and creativity really shine.  I&#8217;ll bet the other teachers ask for your help with their classroom decor often.  Your daughter is lovely and so are the touches you put on her room.  I love the lamp.<br />

		<p>Oh, Kelly -this was a wonderful reminder of how much I loved to have my classroom decorated for my students.  I changed up bulletin boards &amp; decor once a month.  The other teachers thought that I was crazy, but I liked to keep the room fresh for my kids and they loved it.<br />

		<p>Kelly,<br />
Why am I not surprised at how wonderful you&#8217;re new room is?!  You have made the math room a place that even I, not the strongest math student, would want to spend serious learning time in.  Your students are so lucky to have you and I&#8217;m thrilled you were able to make a change that has added a &#8220;spring to your step&#8221;. 😀<br />
Your daughter&#8217;s dorm room is great.  I love kelly green and pink and the room looks fresh and fun.  Great job!<br />
School will start right after Labor day here.  I love back to school time even though my kids are adults.<br />

<em>Thank you so much Karen!  I am thrilled at the job change.  Everyone is going to be fighting for this position if I ever decide to retire! 🙂 I am glad you liked our daughter&#8217;s room too.  This was their second plan.  The first was a travel theme&#8230;we have a quilt with French writing all over it and a &#8220;postcard&#8221; pillow from Pottery Barn.  Guess we will have to save them for a later room (or try to sell them on ebay.)  I definitely like the cheerful pink and green better.<br />

		<p>well, just when I think you couldn&#8217;t top last year&#8217;s room, you went and did it anyway!  love that math room&#8230;.sooo cute and imaginative.   </p>
<p>i&#8217;d say history and literature were my favorite subjects (still are) but math&#8230;.not so much!   however, my husband is a math whiz&#8230;he told me the other day when he was in 4th grade they moved him to 6th grade math (not sure how that happened but he claims it did)&#8230;he is very much a math master!</p>
<p>heading out to more physical therapy on my shoulder this morning&#8230;someone said there the other day it&#8217;s the only place he knows of where torture is legalized!<br />

<em>Wow thank you Judy!  If you liked history and literature, you are definitely a &#8220;story lover.&#8221;  I bet you like to read historical fiction.  Hope your physical therapy is not too torturous this week, and I hope all that pain is doing some good for you!<br />

		<p>I hate to confess that I was not a math fan! History was my favorite subject&#8230;and it still is as I am the family genealogist.  Your class room is so cute and I am sure that if I had you as a math teacher Kelly, I would love math. Fortunately I married a physicist/mathematician and he always helped our children with their math!!<br />

<em>I am jealous of you Arlene!  History was my all time worst subject in school, but once I started teaching it, I loved it.  It was like one long story.  How wonderful that your husband is a mathematician.  My engineer husband always helped our kids with physics and chemistry.  (I was the helper with grammar and writing.)  It is a good thing we all have different talents. 🙂<br />

<em>Thanks a bunch for your kind words Pam.  I did NOT like science in school, but somehow it clicked when I got to college.  (It is still my least favorite subject to teach, though.)  I really think the teacher makes all the difference in the world in whether we catch on or not.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Good grief it has been busy around here!  With three August birthdays, the start of school, sons getting ready for a cross country trip, and daughter moving back to college it seems there has been one immediate need after another this month.  But hopefully things will slow down a little now.  I am <em>so</em> happy to see that Labor Day holiday just a week away! (I bet many of you are, too.)  We can certainly use a breather around here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cake(pp_w746_h497).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11839" width="746" height="497" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(My favorite birthday cake since childhood)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t think I wrote a post to tell about my birthday/anniversary a couple of weeks ago.  My daughter and her roommate did their first drive to Atlanta a week before my birthday to pick up some items for their dorm room and my birthday gift. (Yes, this was one worried-about-the-traffic mom.)   I had made a wish list of several things from several stores, and she was lucky enough to not only find me something that was sold out online, but she also found it <em>on sale</em> in the store.  (And she managed to keep it a secret from me- a MAJOR accomplishment!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bowls-2(pp_w746_h549).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11838" width="746" height="549" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was those cute waffle ice cream bowls from Pottery Barn!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.potterybarn.com/products/ice-cream-stoneware-cone-waffle-bowls/?pkey=e%7Cice%2Bcream%7C2%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C1&amp;group=1&amp;sku=980615&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-Sku_Bottom_Marketing_Rule-_-" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pottery-barn-ice-cream-bowls.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11840" width="691" height="622" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.potterybarn.com/products/ice-cream-stoneware-cone-waffle-bowls/?pkey=e%7Cice%2Bcream%7C2%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C1&amp;group=1&amp;sku=980615&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-Sku_Bottom_Marketing_Rule-_-" target="_blank"><em>potterybarn.com</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had been wanting them all summer, but of course, I thought I would wait until they went on sale.  Well, when they went on sale&#8230;they were gone before I could get them online.  Does that always happen to you, too?  They still have the &#8220;cones&#8221; on sale on line if you need them. 🙂  You all know how much we go through ice cream around here!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tiramisu-cake(pp_w746_h497).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11842" width="746" height="497" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And in August we go through cake!  My husband and children got me the bakery cake with the pink flowers.  My mother made me a delicious tiramisu cake like the one in the photo there.  (Dummy me forgot to take a picture of it, so I am just showing you the one I made last winter&#8230;.but hers looked like that.)  My parents got me a big stack of cookbooks which included this oldie-but-goodie&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.susanbranch.com/"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/susan-branch-book.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11844" width="412" height="516" alt="" /></a><em><a href="http://www.susanbranch.com/" target="_blank">susanbranch.com</a> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>(If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Susan Branch, you need to check out her precious books and her blog &#8211; especially the part on old movies.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our daughter, whose birthday is a week after mine, loves petit fours from the same bakery that makes my pink flower cake.  So my parents got her two dozen of them, and that girl ate almost all of them!   And then&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lunch-1(pp_w746_h497).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11843" width="746" height="497" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We had lunch with my in-laws.  My mother-in-law used to make shrimp creole for this birthday dinner (as she did for our wedding rehearsal dinner), but since the curse-of-the-evil-shellfish-allergy the meal is now roast beef and all the veggies that go with it.  And for dessert, the birthday &#8220;cake&#8221; my mother-in-law made came in the form of this&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cheesecake-1(pp_w746_h496).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11847" width="746" height="496" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am sure I have gained 50 lbs. this month from sweets alone!  Here&#8217;s my gift from my in-laws (probably to sit another cake on..LOL)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/present-1(pp_w746_h503).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11848" width="746" height="503" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am not going to share my husband&#8217;s gift with you until another post, but I guarantee you are going to love it!  Let me just say that it included tickets to something I have been wanting to see. 🙂</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And now in other news&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last Monday morning as I was getting ready for work, our entire road (and beyond) was startled by a very loud, unusual booming sound.  I thought our air conditioner had exploded!  It did it again, and I went running for my husband yelling, &#8220;Something is wrong with&#8230;.&#8221; but before I could finish he said, &#8220;The barbed wire fence is shooting out flames and smoke!  All the wires are glowing!&#8221;  (Yes, I just said barbed wire &#8211; <em>not</em> electric fence.) The exploding sound occurred for a third time, and my parents then called me on their cell phone.  They wanted to know what was shooting off flames on <em>their</em> property, causing explosions, and knocking out their phone service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By then, my husband had concluded (correctly) that a tree must have fallen on one of the power company&#8217;s transformers that sit on the property next to us and hit the fence nearby making it electrical too. He called the power company, and of course, you can only leave a message.  My father then called us back and told us to call 911. Which we did, and that is how we wound up with 2 firetrucks, a sheriff&#8217;s car, two Flint Electic trucks, AND two Georgia Power trucks all in our yard before 8:00 a.m. last Monday morning.   How&#8217;s that for an exciting start to the week? (I told you I was ready for a breather!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/firetrucks-1(pp_w746_h497).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11849" width="746" height="497" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, and here&#8217;s the kind of funny (but really not) part.  There is a dead tree in our front yard that is going to be taken out.  We have had such rain lately that I have been worried about it falling over.  When it does fall, it will land where my son parks his car.  So last weekend I told him to park his car somewhere else so that it would be <em>safer</em>. Guess where he had parked it Sunday night.  Oh yes&#8230;right next to the fence that was shooting out flames and smoke Monday morning!  Luckily it did not get any damage, (but our poor apple tree did.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Okay, so now I have caught you up on birthdays and firetrucks.  So what&#8217;s left&#8230;.? Oh yes!  A new page on the blog!  I thought it would be helpful to have some kind of organization here (more than just the categories and the search box.)  So I have put together a page with all the posts related to our house listed.   It looks like this in the menu above:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/our-house-tag(pp_w736_h77).png" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11850" width="736" height="77" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I will update it as I write more posts about our house.  Hopefully, that will make it easier to find specific things if you happen to be looking for something.  And speaking of the house, I am working on a project with this piece of furniture that I will show you very soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dresser-1.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11851" width="548" height="768" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In fact, I am off to work on it right now.  Hope you have a great start to the last semi-official week of summer.  Do you have plans for Labor Day weekend?</p>

		<p>Phew! I am worn out just reading about all the goings-on around your house. Sounds like it&#8217;s been a quite an August. Sending belated bday greetings to you and your daughter, all those cakes looked amazing! I&#8217;m so glad you received the cute bowls before summer was over &#8211; more ice cream days, ahead! You must be looking forward to a little break for Labor Day, hope you have that Friday off, too. (And, we haven&#8217;t even gone back to school yet&#8230;) Speaking of Susan Branch, she just kicked off a nation-wide tour for her latest book, A Fine Romance, and I got to go and hear her speak. Being a longtime fan it was a great experience that the Sandwich, Mass. library put on. They even served cake and cookies made from the recipe in her books. Hope things are a little quieter for you for awhile, looking forward to the decorating reveal.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Aw man&#8230;I am so very jealous that you got to hear Susan Branch!  I suppose you know that she wrote a post about that visit on her blog?  I wonder if you are in any of the photos?  Her reaction at the start of the post was so funny&#8230;thinking that no one was there because it was so quiet! Have you read her new book?<br />
Thank you for the birthday wishes.  I am afraid we only have Monday off, but we do have a cookout for lunch at school on Friday.  So that will be fun (an awfully nice of the guys who come to cook for us.)<br />
Thanks for the comment on the post!<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly,</p>
<p>     Happy Birthday to you!!  It looks like you had a lovely family dinner and dessert!<br />
     Its funny you mentioning your daughter&#8217;s long distance trip.  Mine (21 years old, senior in college) drove from New England to Virginia beach (alone) about 2 weeks ago to meet up with a friend (&amp; friend&#8217;s family)for a few days on the beach.  I was a WRECK!!  She had to call me every time that she stopped for gas, the bathroom, meals, etc.  She did great!!  She loves to drive, and this trip was good for her &#8211; she finally took a break from her job and had fun 🙂  She even got a kick out of some guys who asked for her phone number while driving down the highway (note written for her to see as the boys passed her). Needless to say, she did not give them the requested number, but it made her Facebook page!<br />
     Last but not least &#8212; the dresser that you are working on is nearly identical to mine, which I have been thinking about tackling with  chalk paint.  I am looking forward to seeing what you do with it:)<br />
Megan<br />

		<p>Happy Belated Birthday, Kelly! I love that you received a Susan Branch book for your birthday.  A mutual love of ours.  I have I think just about every book of hers.  Including her latest &#8220;A Fine Romance&#8221; it&#8217;s a journal about her month-long trip to England in 2013.  As a matter of fact, she&#8217;s actually coming to Michigan in early September to do a book signing.  I&#8217;m going &#8211; so excited.  Looking forward to meeting her.  Labor Day weekend for us will be pretty laid back.  Just going to relax and enjoy our last weekend of the summer before school starts.  Have a blessed week.<br />

<em>Patty, it blows my brain when you all write &#8220;before school starts.&#8221;  We are just about at the midterm of our first grading period here!! (We are the crazy ones though.)  Love Susan Branch books!  I am jealous you get to meet her.  I just read her blog post about her traveling tour promoting the new book.  Looks like fun!  I know that will be great.<br />

		<p>Happy Birthday to all!  Wow, you HAVE had your share of busy and crazy lately! A day does not go by that I don&#8217;t wonder what all that rain there is doing, besides keeping things green. I chat with a friend I&#8217;ve never met who lives in Ga. and she has kept me informed of her weather issues. Scary about that fence, good that it wasn&#8217;t connected to your homes!<br />
We rarely make plans for labor day, unless it&#8217;s for my younger daughter&#8217;s birthday- she was born on the 1st.  We try to not be a part of the crazy traffic jams, so stick to our area for fun.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>I have been so tired of the rain, but I am sooooo thankful that it wasn&#8217;t dry like it normally is in August.  All the grass is burned beneath the fence all the way down our property, and even the fence burnt into pieces on my parents&#8217; property.  If it had been dry, all the pastures and the forest would have been on fire around here.  We have been blessed with the rain!<br />
Tell your daughter happy early birthday!<br />

		<p>Happy happy birthday sweet kelly!  Wow!  You sure have been experiencing a lot lately&#8230;hopefully things will settle down for you and you can have a nice relaxing Labor Day.   As you know, I&#8217;ve had numerous health problems for several months and to top it off, developed a bladder infection last week!  Had to leave my Birmingham grandchildren&#8217;s birthday party early Saturday evening I was so sick with it.   I think I&#8217;m on the mend now&#8230;hopefully.   Then I got news last week that a good friend of mine passed away while vacationing in the Bahamas with family and friends&#8230;her funeral was yesterday but I was too sick to go.   That really puts things in perspective&#8230;.she was only 64!</p>
<p>We may go to the lake for Labor Day&#8230;will be about the last time we take out the boat for the year.   This summer has gone by way too fast.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great (and non-eventful) week!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Good grief!  A bladder infection is NO fun.  And I hate you had to miss part of your grandchildren&#8217;s party.  I do hope you are well by now.  How sad about your friend.  She was too young!  And being out of the country when you die sure makes for complications with funerals.  I hope the family did not have to deal with the stress of that.  Hope you get to enjoy the boat one last time this weekend.  I think it is supposed to be pretty warm, so enjoy your time at the lake.<br />
Kelly</em></p>

		<p>Wow! And I thought I had been busy! Never a dull moment at your place!! I don&#8217;t know why I was so surprised that one of your BD cakes was the white one with pink roses&#8211; mine,too! And that you love Susan&#8217;s books&#8211; me, too! I told you when I finally got up the &#8220;nerve&#8221; to reply to your blog posts&#8211;(yes, went several months without texting!) that we had so many things in common. I really believe you are my &#8220;sister&#8211; by another mom&#8221;! I speak of you and your blog so much that you feel like family!:) No special plans for Labor Day &#8212; but Sept. Is a full month for our family&#8211; both of my girl&#8217;s BD are this month&#8211; so fun times are ahead. Work hard this week with your eyes looking toward the 3 day weekend!<br />

<em>You are so right Louvina&#8230;it is NEVER dull here.  🙂  I will have to tell my dad that I have another mom out there!LOL  Your September is our August.  I am looking forward to the weekend.  It was cool and fallish her yesterday but is warming up through the weekend.  I was so hoping we would have that beautiful autumn weather for Labor Day, but it is not going to happen.  August just fooled me!<br />

		<p>Happy birthday Kelly. I love your ice cream bowls. So glad your daughter found them for you. I have waited for things to be marked down and missed out on things that I really wanted. So any more if I love it I will buy it. I have been sorry I waited to many times to count. Wow! You have had a busy time around your home.Hope things are relaxing for you labor day week end.can&#8217;t wait to see what you are going to do with your dresser. I am thinking you will paint it. We will have to wait and see. Yarlette<br />

<em>I thought those ice cream bowls were just the cutest thing!  And I always have good luck finding things at the PB outlet, but when we went there recently, they didn&#8217;t even have them.  Since they were sold out online and the outlet didn&#8217;t have them, I figured I had totally lost out. So I was thrilled when our daughter gave them to me for my birthday.  Total surprise! I guess I should take your advice and buy things that I love when I see them.<br />
Dresser is coming along&#8230;.<br />

		<p>Happy Birthday! Oh My, all the food is wonderful, it&#8217;s just 7:30 am but I am ready for lunch now (&amp; dessert). The fence fiasco is crazy!!! How scary !! Glad that no one was hurt. Many years ago we had a hurricane come through and my mother-in-law moved  her car from under the pine trees to the back field and guess what&#8230; the field flooded with 14 feet of water, yes, her car was under water. So sometimes our well planned ideas are not so great.<br />
Love the waffles bowls, really pretty and so sweet of your daughter to find them.<br />
Hope this week is a good one!<br />

		<p>Happy Birthday, Kelly &#8211; but goodness, hope Labor Day weekend is quiet!! I have been quiet in Blogland because in July by son got engaged and is getting married in our backyard on Sept 7 &#8211; about a 6 week notice!!! Major projects done but i could easily work in the garden 8 hours a day. Pretty soon I am going to have to say it&#8217;s &#8220;done&#8221;.  Life sure doesn&#8217;t come in neat packages because a week ago my MIL passed away. We spent this past week driving 3000+ miles to attend the funeral. It was a precious time but we had to turn around and head back home. (Flights were ridiculously expensive). So our Labor Day weekend will be full of weed-eating, mowing, tweaking the garden, shopping for the rest of our clothing for the event, food shopping (company begins to arrive the Tuesday before the wedding). I intend to enjoy the fun and not get stressed unduly!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Oh my goodness, Barbara!  You have had your plate majorly full!  I am so sorry to hear about your mother in law.  3000+ miles is a lot &#8211; especially when dealing with the passing of someone close. And 6 weeks to prepare for a wedding would make my head spin.  Good luck to you (and lots of energy too!) in getting everything done.  You need more than a Labor Day weekend.  I hope you do get to enjoy all the festivities to their fullest.<br />

		<p>Happy Birthday, Kelly!  I hope you have a wonderfully relaxing Labor Day weekend planned&#8230;you deserve it!  We just moved our youngest into his dorm today.  It is strangely quiet, but he seemed excited, so therefore we are, too. 😉<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>That means your baby has gone off to college. Congratulations,Lisa!  Yes, it will be strangely quiet for awhile&#8230;but then they come back. 🙂  Enjoy the quiet while you can.  And rest&#8230;moving someone anywhere is exhausting!  (And boys seem to have as much &#8220;stuff&#8221; as girls often do.)</p>
