				<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Talk-of-the-House-decorating-for-a-new-year(pp_w755_h503).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13362" width="755" height="503" alt="Talk of the House decorating for a new year" />Last night we were riding home from enjoying dinner out, and I noticed something I thought was somewhat unusual.  It&#8217;s eight days into the month of January, right?  Well, our little town<em> still</em> has all of its Christmas lights up, and they were <em>lit</em>!  We rode around a few blocks downtown looking at some houses, and there were quite a few of them that still had their Christmas decorations on too.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It is almost like we don&#8217;t want the Christmas season to leave here.  (It was much too short this year anyway.) Yes, I know many of you are already getting out your things for Valentine&#8217;s Day, but I have mixed a touch of Christmas in with New Year&#8217;s for our January decorating.  I just didn&#8217;t get enough time to enjoy it during the rush of December. When does your town take down their Christmas lights?</p>
<p>You have already seen the dining room for New Year&#8217;s Eve, but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to show you the other vignettes around here.  You are about to see how much<em> blue</em> has replaced all the red.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/family-room-with-blue-floral-and-neutrals(pp_w755_h453).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13363" width="755" height="453" alt="family room with blue floral and neutrals" /></p>
<p>I made those blue floral pillows many many years ago from a Waverly fabric (I think.)  The family room cabinet got dressed up for New Years with Christmas balls in a jar.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cabinet-vignette-mixing-Christmas-in-for-New-Years(pp_w755_h486).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13364" width="755" height="486" alt="cabinet vignette mixing Christmas in for New Years" /></p>
<p>For the mantel, a collection of clocks and watches works well&#8230;and yes, I put them in a jar. None of the watches work, and the clocks are inexpensive ones collected from Walmart, Target, and Steinmart.  There might be one old one from Pottery Barn in the mix.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Talk-of-the-House-kitchen-desk-with-New-Years-recipe-on-chalkboard.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13373" width="510" height="768" alt="Talk of the House kitchen desk with  New Years recipe on chalkboard" />I brought in the blue cookbooks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blue-cookbooks-for-color-and-use(pp_w755_h463).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13374" width="755" height="463" alt="blue cookbooks for color and use" />And you can see that the black and white drapes are back in place of the red buffalo checked ones.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks for allowing me to extend my holiday decorating just a bit longer. 🙂 In a week or two it will all be gone, and the red and hearts for the day of love will be making its entrance.  (I must confess that I have been checking out the chocolates that are already out in the stores!) So how many of you have already started decorating with things for Valentine&#8217;s Day??</p>

		<p>This is a somewhat random question but do you eat the cereal from your jars and if so does it stay fresh?  I have the same jars but haven&#8217;t used them for cereal.  I used them for my sons rehearsal dinner a couple of months ago.  It was picnic style so I put potato salad and corn salad in them.  Very cute and practical kept the bugs out.  Also used one to put rolls in.  Love your blog and your house.<br />

<em>Oh yes, Cindy, we DO eat the cereal, and it does stay fresh.  But we go through a lot of cereal!  I can finish off my jar of Cheerios pretty quickly. 🙂  (It&#8217;s on the grocery list for today, in fact!) I LOVE your idea of using the jars for salads and rolls&#8230;will probably steal that idea from you for a dinner later in the year.  Thank you for reading!<br />

		<p>Kelly,</p>
<p>  I have started to gather Christmas items into the spare bedroom (tea towels, mugs, etc.) So that they can be packed away this weekend. We leave our decorations up until the baptism of Jesus which will be at Mass this weekend. We are Catholic and I teach at a private Catholic grade school so all of the decorations like my tree and nativity are all still up in my classroom there also. I will switch to St. Valentine&#8217;s day decorations this weekend in both places. The kids love to have decorations up always! I love your infusion of blue. It is so calming! My favorite spot in your home right now is by that blazing fireplace. I could just make a nice hot drink at your drink stations in the kitchen and curl up next to the fireplace and read. You make your home so very inviting! Thanks for sharing it with us.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<em>Your spare bedroom sounds like our study.  Ours is still piled with gift wrap, boxes, and ribbon to be packed away.  I love the Catholic church&#8217;s observation of the baptism of Jesus. It certainly gives more meaning to the holiday season.  It&#8217;s kind of crazy that we end our season with the BIRTH of Jesus.(shaking my head here.) I love the fireplace too&#8230;that is &#8220;my&#8221; chair there with the ottoman. 🙂  You are welcome to come, fix a drink, and sit anytime you would like, Dawn. 🙂<br />

		<p>I usually leave my Christmas decorations up until just after New Years Day.  Well, with catching the flu, it has put me behind.  Just getting my wind back now and am putting the décor away this week.  I usually bring back out more of my white ironstone, mercury glass, moss accents and ceramic birds.  I go with a more winter nature feel with the décor.  I keep up some greenery with white Italian lights as well.  The outside red ribbon décor will stay until the end of the month, as we are pretty snowed in, here in the Midwest.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what your décor will be like for Valentines Kelly.</p>

<em>Oh no, Debra that is terrible!! The flu is awful, and it does take awhile to get your strength back.  And then goodness having to face putting away Christmas.  Not good.  I hope the weekend is a good one for you.  Your winter nature décor sounds very pretty.  The mix of the ironstone with mercury glass and moss alone would be beautiful. Get good and well!<br />

		<p>Kelly,<br />
I&#8217;m usually one of the first people on our park to take my outdoor lights down, this year our lights are still up and lit, as is most of our neighbors.  It makes me happy.  Our lights will come down this weekend.</p>
<p>Love the blue touches and the plate rack with the white and blue and white plates.</p>
<p>Xo,<br />

<em>That is interesting that so many people everywhere still have theirs up this late.  I wonder if it is always like that, and I am just doing a better job noticing it this year&#8230;or was the season so short that many more people are keeping theirs up later this year.  Good luck with taking it all down this weekend.  I am glad my son took the outside garlands down for us this week since it is raining and raining and raining here today.<br />
Here&#8217;s to a productive weekend!<br />

		<p>Kelly, love the blue! The clocks in the jar are a real neat idea for decorating in the New Year!  Creative and unexpected.  I may keep my eye out for old vintage clocks now when I go thrifting.  I am not decorating for Valentine&#8217;s Day yet, but gathering up some ideas.  I enjoying the clean house right now since we took down all the Christmas decorations.  I will be ready in a few weeks though I&#8217;m sure.<br />

<em>That&#8217;s a great idea to be on the lookout for the clocks as you are thrifting.  I wish I had thought of it sooner to get my mom to look out for them when she was at yardsales.  (She&#8217;s the queen!)<br />

		<p>I like to leave our Christmas decorations up until after the New Year (all that work needs to be shown off &amp; enjoyed for a bit longer than a few days after the 25th!) and like Cathy, I too grew up celebrating a Ukrainian Christmas, our &#8220;2nd Christmas&#8221;!</p>
<p>The threading of blue accents throughout your home look awesome and your posts ARE better than getting a PB catalog in the mail! Not only did PB feature blue on the cover of their new catalog, but did you notice the cover of January&#8217;s Southern Living issue? Love the change from all the &#8220;Christmas red&#8221; that&#8217;s been around for weeks!<br />

<em>I need to do a little research to learn more about the Ukrainian Christmas.  It sounds like something I would like!  I have read almost every Patricia Polacco book for children, and she writes quite a bit about her Ukrainian grandmother and her traditions, but I do not remember reading about a &#8220;lengthened&#8221; holiday. I must find out! Thank you for your kind words about the decorating here.  I DID notice all the blue on the SL cover, and if you get Talbot&#8217;s catalogs, they too had blue in all their new winter clothing. I don&#8217;t ever recall this happening before! 🙂 I guess great minds think alike. LOL<br />

		<p>Driving home from church last night, we were commenting on how many Christmas lights we saw. I enjoy them, it&#8217;s a little sad when they are all put away. Husband undecorated both trees and put it all away (what a guy!) now I have to pack away the rest of the Christmas decor. Hopefully, today. Love the touches of blue and the clocks, Kelly.

He now has a new &#8220;skill.&#8221; 🙂 (but I forgot to tell him to separate the twinkle lights from the non-twinkle ones.)Thank you for reading and leaving your kind comment here, Kelly.<br />

		<p>I love the clocks in jars!  I agree with Donna (above)&#8230;when I open email and see you have a new post, it IS like getting the new Pottery Barn catalog.  I probably would have left Christmas decorations up a little longer but my college student son helps put everything up and then helps take it down&#8230;so I had to accept the help when I could get it.  I went to lunch last Friday and when I got home he had taken all of the ornaments off the tree and brought  Snow Village boxes out for me to pack everything away.  My daughter is the town manager where we live and she says the town snowflake decorations are staying up a few more days.  Since she hasn&#8217;t &#8220;undecorated&#8221; her apartment from Christmas, I would say we can enjoy the town decorations a little longer.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>How wonderful to have all that help!  (And it really is needed when you do a lot of holiday decorating.)  My son took down and bagged all the outdoor garlands.  That was a tremendous amount of help for me!  And my husband always brings in and sets up the trees in stands.  It&#8217;s the darn lights that are always the hardest and most time consuming things.  I love that your town Christmas lights are still up.  You all enjoy them as long as you can!<br />

		<p>Drool, drool.  I adore what you&#8217;ve done.  Blue is so calming, especially after such a hectic holiday season.

		<p>Christmas came down the day after here,but the tree is still on the front porch as are the boxes of decorations. It&#8217;s too cold to get out there and do anything with them.

		<p>Hi Kelly! Love the blue accents&#8230;.very pretty. And all the clocks in the jars are so cute. I was rereading the old posts about your kitchen transformation the other day and noticed one of the jars on your kitchen counter even way back then. You&#8217;re such a trend setter! 😀<br />
Yesterday I &#8220;reworked&#8221; our living room with aqua and turquoise. I guess it&#8217;s a little Spring-y, but I was ready for a fresh change. I may bring a little red back for the &#8220;day of love.&#8221; (I love that you call it that.)<br />
Our outdoor Christmas lights are still up. It&#8217;s been way too cold to take them down so we&#8217;ve been enjoying them a little longer. I&#8217;m always sad to turn them off, but I finally did last night. I didn&#8217;t want us to be &#8220;that house.&#8221; LOL!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>I think we are now &#8220;that house.&#8221; LOL.  There is a Christmas tree with lights on in the window above the porch that is STILL lit at night. The garlands are down, but they are in trash bags all over the front porch&#8230;not exactly a pretty sight to see.  I guess the tree lights will go off once we get the bags moved up to the attic&#8230;or not. 🙂  The cold weather probably has kept many people from taking down their holiday décor outside.  And I imagine spring-y decorating (like in your living room) is appreciated by many people who are enduring the extreme temperatures this week.<br />
Stay warm!<br />

		<p>I felt Christmas was too short this year and just love the warmth of the Christmas lights. I have seen many homes with the Christmas lights still on and it seems more than usual this year. Maybe we all need the Christmas spirit a bit longer. I leave my snowflakes and snowmen out for the winter decorations, but the blue touches is a wonderful idea. Love the clocks!<br />
Kelly when I see you have a new post I feel like I do when a new Pottery Barn catalogue has arrived. Your home is beautiful and you have such a nice way of decorating.

<em>We should lobby for a change that keeps Thanksgiving from arriving after some specific date&#8230;like Nov. 20 or so!  I&#8217;ll start a petition. 🙂 LOL That way we can enjoy Christmas for a longer period of time AND Thanksgiving will still have a chance to shine in November. I like the idea of keeping out snowflakes and snowmen.  They can stay through February! And I am glad you liked all the blue. Thank you for such wonderful compliments about the home, Donna.<br />

		<p>The first two pictures of your house look like they came straight out of the newest Pottery Barn catalog! I really like the blue touches in your pretty house.<br />
When my children were small we always turned our Christmas tree into a snow tree (lots of snow themed ornaments)after Christmas and kept it up through January. I started that tradition again this year with the tree we have on our porch. I really wanted to replace the artificial tree on the porch with the live tree we had in the living room for this project but when we started to trade out we realized the live tree was just too dry.I am thinking next year I will just get two &#8220;real&#8221; trees as I don&#8217;t think the porch tree will dry out that much.<br />
Thankfully my small town still has all its pretty twinkle lights on all the trees that line the downtown. Most of the store windows are now decorated in a white snow theme.<br />
Thanks for another pretty post!<br />

<em>Katrina, when we took down our porch tree it felt just as fresh as when we put it out there for the holidays.  Keeping it out in the cold certainly kept it fresher than the one in the family room that endured the heat of the fireplace and the regular central heat and air system.  So you should definitely get a fresh one for your porch next year.<br />
Thank you for reading and leaving your thoughtfully sweet comments.<br />

		<p>Kelly ,<br />
Had never really thought of replacing my reds from Christmas  with blue for the new year until I read your blog, but I love that idea. And displaying clocks and watches is a great way to welcome in a  new beginning.  Can&#8217;t  begin to think about decorating for Valentines Day yet as my grandaughter&#8217;s 1st birthday celebration is the weekend of the nineteenth and with a Cheerios theme we&#8217;ll be decorating in yellow!  Red and pink will make its appearance after that, take care, Lindy<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>As I sit here munching on my daily dose of Cheerios, I LOVE the idea for the birthday party!  How cute!!!  Happy yellow is always a good color. 🙂  Thank you for your kind compliments on the décor. Have a great day!<br />

		<p>I really needed this restful stress less post. Truly just relaxed and took it all in&#8211; there is just something peaceful about a touch of blue!! I too don&#8217;t want the spirit of Christmas to be put away&#8211; I&#8217;m still hanging onto snowflakes and winter greenery. Thank you for helping me tonight in ways you&#8217;ll never know.

		<p>Hi Kelly,</p>
<p>OK &#8211; it&#8217;s official!  I want to come and live in your house forever!  I love what you are doing with your new year colours.</p>
<p>I just de-decorated the Christmas tree since we like to keep everything up until the Ukrainian (Julian calendar) Christmas is over (January 7). When they are gone I too miss the lovely ambience that is created with the lights and decorations of Christmas.  Oh well, our fireplace will have to provide the light and warmth that I desire!</p>
<p>And regarding Valentine&#8217;s decorating… I really have never done that except when I was teaching.  Maybe I will this year &#8211; inspired by you of course!</p>
<p>Take care<br />
Cath</p>
<p>P.S.  I think this is the first time I have been the first commenter.  Yay for me!!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Oh yes, yay for you being first, Cath!  You are welcome to come on and live here as soon as we finish the room over the garage. 🙂  (Although everyone around the house here seems to be saying that it will be &#8220;their&#8221; space.) A fireplace certainly does help to give a glow of warmth, but nothing really beats twinkle lights.<br />
Kelly</em></p>

				<p><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Downton-Abbey-mincemeat-pies-and-tea(pp_w755_h505).jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13331" width="755" height="505" alt="Downton Abbey mincemeat pies and tea" />I really wasn&#8217;t going to watch it.  Nope&#8230;wasn&#8217;t going to.  The horribly sad ending of  Downton Abbey season 3 was more than enough to make me say, &#8220;No more.&#8221;  But then&#8230;my daughter has been watching season 4 already (<em>don&#8217;t ask me how&#8230;</em>) and I asked her if the new season was worth watching now that you-know-who is gone.  She said, &#8220;Most definitely.&#8221;  So I had her pick up a package of Mincement Tarts for me at <a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/product/downton-abbey-mincemeat-tarts.do?&amp;from=Search" target="_blank">World Market</a> last week, and I will be making a pot of tea in my old teapot to settle in and watch tonight&#8217;s American season premiere.  I have never tasted mincemeat but thought it would be something different to try.  What I really wanted were these:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/product/downton+abbey+luxury+assorted+shortbread+tin.do?&amp;from=Search" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shortbread.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13332" width="449" height="580" alt="shortbread" /></a><a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/product/downton+abbey+luxury+assorted+shortbread+tin.do?&amp;from=Search" target="_blank"><em>worldmarket.com</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">and this&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/product/the+republic+of+tea+downton+abbey+tea+tin.do?&amp;from=Search" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Downton-Abbey-tea.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13333" width="295" height="594" alt="Downton Abbey tea" /></a><a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/product/the+republic+of+tea+downton+abbey+tea+tin.do?&amp;from=Search" target="_blank"><em>worldmarket.com</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But those items were sold out. I have heard that they will be back in stock in February if you are looking for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There have been soooooo many programs, books, magazine articles, and blog posts written about Highclere Castle that I have been on overload on it. And even beyond that, I think the characters and the part of the house I <em>really</em> like the best are the servants and their quarters.  Here is a cutaway of the layout of the sets to give you a refresher before tonight&#8217;s show.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/24/article-2528645-1A4679A700000578-652_964x492.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/cutaway-of-the-layout-of-Downton-Abbey(pp_w755_h381).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13335" width="755" height="381" alt="cutaway of the layout of Downton Abbey" /></a><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/24/article-2528645-1A4679A700000578-652_964x492.jpg" target="_blank"><em>i.dailymail.co.uk</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The upstairs is filmed in the castle, but the servants quarters are actually filmed in sets built for the show since that area of the castle has been changed from how it looked long ago.  I would not want a kitchen identical to the one in the series, but there are a number of elements of English kitchens that I do love.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And the gorgeous cabinets.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Linda Merrill did a fun board to get the look of the Downton kitchen.  Click on the photo, and it will take you to her page where you can find the links for the products on her Pinterest board.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chameleon-interiors.blogspot.com/2012/01/get-that-look-downton-abbey-kitchen.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DA-Get-that-look-kitchen.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13340" width="494" height="640" alt="DA Get that look kitchen" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">She also did one on the servants quarters that you might enjoy. The bed and cabinet are beautiful, and that bed is the Coleman bed from Pottery Barn (<a href="http://www.potterybarn.com/products/coleman-iron-bed/?pkey=cmetal-beds-headboards" target="_blank">now on sale</a>) that I had planned to use in our sons&#8217; room before we decided to build their beds.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The writers at Design*Sponge did a great post on Downton Abbey and featured it as part of their <em>Living In</em> series.  Here is their board.  Again if you click on it, you can find the sources for the products shown (including that wonderful yellow English mixing bowl.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2012/01/living-in-downton-abbey.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Living-in-Downton-Abbey-from-Design-Sponge.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13342" width="500" height="600" alt="Living in Downton Abbey from Design Sponge" /></a><a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2012/01/living-in-downton-abbey.html" target="_blank"><em>designsponge.com</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And since everyone has jumped on the Downton Abbey marketing bandwagon, it was high time for the paint to come out.  Mylands (who has been around since 1884 and supplied the paint for every James Bond and Harry Potter film)  makes the paint that is used in the servants quarters of Downton.  It is available through their <a href="http://coloursoflondon.co.uk/colours-of-london.html" target="_blank">Colours of London</a> collection. Mrs. Patmore&#8217;s kitchen is painted with their Amber Grey, and Mr. Carson&#8217;s pantry is Empire Grey.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://coloursoflondon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Myland-Paints-1024x684(pp_w717_h478).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13350" width="717" height="478" alt="Myland Paints" /></a><a href="http://coloursoflondon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>coloursoflondon.co.uk</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am not sure how well received they have been in the UK since not everyone wants their rooms to look like servants&#8217; quarters. 🙂 I understand that the kitchen does get a new..um..character??</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ed/90/d4/ed90d4e6ef6442082569edbccb8a1a60.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mixer(pp_w672_h672).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13353" width="672" height="672" alt="mixer" /></a></p>

		<p>I LOVE Downton Abbey! My husband and I just happened on it one Sunday night after church and was hooked for a season. My daughter bought us season 1&amp;2 for our birthdays last year and season 3 for my birthday this year. I waited until I was recouping from surgery in February to do a DA marathon. I was very sad at the 3rd season ending but will continue watching when the next season is out on DVD. I love all the characters! Each add so much to the show with their individual personalities but my favorite thing about this show is how the servants are treated. They are almost part of the family and included in different occasions. For those of you who have not watched DA you really must, you are missing out on a real treat.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Oooohhh a marathon!  How fun!  (Hope your surgery wasn&#8217;t serious.)  Yes, season 3 was VERY sad.  You will like the end of season 4 I think.  That is a good point about how the servants are treated.  I had not thought of that, and it does really add to the show. Thank you for reading and leaving your comment, Lorrie.<br />

		<p>I too was horrified by the end of season 3.  However, in the interim I&#8217;ve read and watched many interviews with Julian Fellowes (creator, writer and director of DA) where he explained in great detail what happened.  The guy who played Matthew refused to come back for any more seasons.  They begged the actor to come back even for a few episodes or even 1 episode in season 4 so they wouldn&#8217;t have to kill him at the end of 3 (remember in England each season finale is played on Christmas so all of England had to watch his death on Christmas for Pete&#8217;s sake!) &#8211; but he refused. Julian did not want to &#8220;break them up&#8221; as they had a true love story and would not have divorced &#8211; so he had no choice but to kill the character.  It&#8217;s 100% the fault of the actor (which is so ridiculous in my opinion.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll never hear of him again. Arrogance.) &#8211; but I&#8217;m not holding it against the show.  Loved the episode Sunday night &#8211; can&#8217;t wait for the next however-many Sundays.  It requires tea each week for sure.  Shortbread is super-easy to bake. Love, love love the show!  Great blog post &#8211; I love that kitchen!<br />

<em>Thank you for all the information, Elle.  I had known that Dan Stevens wanted to leave the show, but I did not realize how unreasonable he had been about it.  I can&#8217;t understand WHY he would want to leave when the show has such a wonderful following and he had such a fabulous role in it.  Oh well, I thought Sunday night&#8217;s episode was great even without him. 🙂 Looking forward to the coming episodes, too.<br />

		<p>I just got on the DA bandwagon this year &#8211; for anyone who waited like me, you can kind of catch up on the PBS website, check google/bing for DA synopsis links &#8211; I feel fairly confident I know what&#8217;s going on and thoroughly enjoyed the first episode this season, while on our THIRD day off school!!! Yes &#8211; one day for snow, one for buses that couldn&#8217;t start, another for snow, and tomorrow for sub-zero temperatures. I&#8217;ve rewritten my 2nd semester lesson plans twice, and am ready to get away from the refrigerator (I blame my school district for the last 3 pounds I&#8217;ve gained&#8230;)<br />

<em>Thanks for the info on catching up with the series, Susie.  I hope those who need it will see your comment here.  Third day off from school&#8230;VERY jealous!  Every single county around us closed school today due to the extreme cold (wind chill of -1 this morning in Georgia) except for ours!  Boy the comments from parents really blasted our superint. for his decision.  AND I&#8217;ve been told that one of our buses broke down for 30 minutes with children on it and no heat, and we had classrooms in our school whose heater did not work. My morning duty of unloading cars was freezing but fun&#8230;had a parent offer to get me hot chocolate and another gave me a tube of moisturizer for my hands.  (Wasn&#8217;t that sweet!)  Would you believe it is supposed to be 70 here this weekend?  Crazy!<br />

		<p>Oh, don&#8217;t tell me you were only a fair weather fan! The season opener did not disappoint, once again Dame Maggie got all the great lines. And, it was wonderful catching up with all the old, familiar faces. And, think of all the plot lines that can open up with heiress Mary, available once again. (More rivalries with Edith, perhaps.)The two hours certainly flew by, can&#8217;t wait for next week. I, too, held out from accessing the new season early or from trying to get some scoop from overseas cousins! It was worth the wait.<br />

<em>Not a fair weather fan&#8230;I&#8217;d watch faithfully for 3 seasons.  It just killed me that my favorite character would no longer be there..hard to imagine it being just as good without you-know-who.  Anyway, I thought it was just as good! (Oh ye of little faith, right?)  The two hours did fly by quickly!  It will be interesting to see what they do with Rose.  She can certainly get herself into some trouble, can&#8217;t she?!<br />

		<p>CANNOT BELIEVE I FORGOT IT WAS ON! So, I just set the DVR to record the repeat episode, and to get the rest of this season. Now I just have to hope hubby doesn&#8217;t bump me off the DVR!!! Somehow I knew there was something I wanted to watch last night, but I asked hubs if anything was on, and he said &#8220;not that you want to watch&#8221;!!! Guess he didn&#8217;t know I was into DA. Sunday tv around here gets kind of crazy, seems a lot of times, we run out of room on the DVR. Then nothing for most of the other days!<br />

<em>Oh no!  I am glad we didn&#8217;t give away any spoilers here. 🙂  I hope your husband doesn&#8217;t bump you off too.  Perhaps you can convert him to a DA fan?  Write it on your calendar for next Sunday night so that you don&#8217;t forget again. 🙂<br />

		<p>Kelly, this has been by far the best post on Downton Abbey I have read, thanks for sharing the castle layout, so cool. I was definitely watching&#8230;couldn&#8217;t wait. Not sure who my favorite character is but my least favorite was O&#8217;Brien (but she did make things interesting) and we still have Barrow.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>Thank you Cheri!  It was a fun post to do research on.  (You can find sooooo much on Downton online.) I, too, was glad O&#8217;Brien left, and I liked how they fit it into the storyline.  Sunday night&#8217;s episode certainly showed us that Barrow can do his trouble-making without her, can&#8217;t he?!  I&#8217;m guessing the new nanny will take O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s place as someone we love to hate.  It will be interesting to see!<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly,</p>
<p>Oh yes… I am a HUGE Downton Abbey fan… and during our time sailing in New Zealand and on to S. Africa I have met others around the world who are just as mad about it as I.  </p>
<p>At one anchorage in Great Barrier Island, New Zealand we invited the couple in the sailboat anchored next to us to come for dinner.  We flew our boat banner in honour of their visit so our guests (British) showed up dressed in DA style.  After rummaging through what we had onboard we too morphed into characters from the show (amazing what a long flowing scarf and a sunhat can do for a costume!).  What fun we had that night! … And the accents were authentic!</p>
<p>My favourite character is Dowager Countess Violet played by Maggie Smith although there are many strong characters on the show.</p>
<p>I have always loved the servant quarters and kitchens of old manor houses and have salivated over many of the details of each kitchen I&#8217;ve seen.  Lovely to dream about… never to be attained (neither our boat nor our wee 100 year old wooden house will accommodate such kitchens…).</p>
<p>Thanks for this post, Kelly.  I watch DA online or on DVD wherever I am in the world!</p>
<p> Talk with you soon<br />
Cath<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<em>I forget about it having a &#8220;worldwide&#8221; appeal. That is so amazing!  And how fun to share your love of the show with others from different countries. I bet your dinner party was so much fun! I am with you on being a Maggie Smith fan.  If she ever leaves the show, it will certainly not be good.<br />
I hope you stay warm snuggled up by the fireplace in your home.  Loved the photo of your big dog at Christmas on your blog. 🙂<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a total non-TV watcher, but when everyone kept telling me I HAD TO WATCH this show, I broke down. Oh my goodness, I&#8217;m TOTALLY HOOKED.  Usually I prefer reading books, but this show is unbelievably good. I was so sad for days about Sybil and Matthew (my favorites), but I&#8217;m already enjoying this new season. I love them all, but Anna and Daisy are special ;). This was such a fun post. I&#8217;m saving it for later to read when I have more time and I can savor it!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>Lisa, I am with you on not watching much television.  Downton is quite different from most anything on, isn’t it?!  Anna and Daisy are just wonderfully sweet characters.  I am really interested to see what they are going to do with Daisy this year.  I am happy you enjoyed the post!  (It was fun doing the research for it. )<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly! I was so looking forward to DA last night, what a wonderful change from all that football we&#8217;ve been watching lately:) We had gameday snacks but maybe next week I&#8217;ll make some shortbread to go with DA, what a great idea:) My husband and I both enjoy watching it, so fun! Thanks for the heads up on the products from World Market, will make a fun Christmas gift for a girlfriend next year, better write that down in my planner now. Enjoy your day!<br />

<em>Oh yes, Downton is most certainly a big change from football, Kelly! LOL  (But I like football snacks anytime. )  You are lucky your husband enjoys the series too.  Definitely add the World Market items to your planner, and get then early.  They sell out rather quickly.  I have a “Christmas next year” list started like you, too.<br />

		<p>I feel like I might get boo-hissed but&#8230;I have not watched DA.  I did try last night but I felt way too lost and gave up.  However, I do love your blog.<br />

<em>No boo-hiss from me.  It would be very confusing to start watching Sunday night without knowing all the background – sort of like starting in the middle of long novel.  I started near the end of the first season and had to go back to the start even then to make sure I understood each character’s history. You need to get your hands on the first 3 seasons (which are much shorter than American television seasons) and start with them.  I am glad you enjoy the blog!<br />

		<p>Hi Kelly, Can you believe I&#8217;ve never watched the show?  I&#8217;m always reluctant, for some reason, to start watching a series.

		<p>I hate to admit it&#8230;but my daughters and I are addicted to Downton Abbey! I got seasons 1- 3 for Christmas. We enjoyed watching them again over the holidays, this time with the subtitles on. We were surprised at the diction we had missed.</p>
<p>The premiere of season 4 was good tonight, although we really missed Matthew. (We munched on blueberry scones while watching.)<br />

		<p>I could be happy as a pig in a mud puddle during August in that kitchen!!  I love the wood stove, the big work table and more.  I hope to build a much smaller but similar version of that table this coming summer for my own kitchen, but counter height (to save my back).  I have yet to see even one episode of this show because we stream and because I refuse to pay for Netflix or HuluPlus (remember when TV was FREE!)

<em>Rose, I agree with you that many of the old ways are still the best ways.  Perhaps that is why the old things are still so attractive to us.  The old cabinets and tables are just plain beautiful, and so are the old mixing bowls.  We do not have cable television, so I watch it on pbs on Sunday nights….free.   (And since it is on pbs, there are no commercial interruptions.)  I need to find you a free source for the older seasons so that you will get hooked on it too. <br />

		<p>I&#8217;m a beginner quilter and at a local quilting shop their block of the month quilt this year is based on Downton Abbey (DA) fabrics. They have two quilts &#8211; one in a black/gray/red colorway and the other is more pastel in nature. I first heard about DA from you, but really know nothing about it.  I might have to check into it based on this blog, your readers&#8217; comments, the quilts at the quilting shop plus a friend who is an avid DA&#8217;er and was able to fill me in more about the program.

		<p>Well my biscuits are done, courtesy of Martha Stewart&#8217;s recipe on Instagram!  I will be heating the teapot soon and settling into my favorite chair.   I have not been watching DA for long so I am not too familiar with the characters.  Enjoy your treats!Mincemeats are my favorite.<br />

<em>Yum, Anita!  Biscuits and hot tea sound delicious! If you have not been watching the series for long, you might want to find a site that gives a synopsis of the old episodes to catch up (perhaps at pbs.org?)  There are so many characters, it could be confusing. I did enjoy the mincemeat tarts, but hot biscuits sound MUCH better. <br />

		<p>Kelly, Had done the exact thing you planned &#8211; so upset by the last season that I wasn&#8217;t going to watch again.  But my friends told me to buck up because we all have to watch and then discuss it to the nth degree &#8212; who could resist that? The other big draw for me was reading about how fabulous the costumes are with the 20s fashion being simply outstanding.</p>
<p>My favorite character has to be Maggie Smith&#8217;s dowager countess!  Those zingers of hers are simply priceless and her delivery could not be more perfect.  She is such a treasure &#8211; in character or as herself!</p>
<p>Our treats for watching the show: Walker&#8217;s shortbread and hot cocoa.  And some cozy blankets too as it&#8217;s darn cold outside!</p>
<p>Happy watching! Love all the sources you shared!!! Hugs,, Pippa<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<em>Oh yes, you HAD to watch! 🙂  And the fashions are quite gorgeous.  Such eye candy!  Maggie Smith steals the show for sure, though.  I had some Walker&#8217;s shortbread in the pantry, and if I don&#8217;t make my own next week, I will try them with tea for the second episode next week.<br />
It is VERY cold here&#8230;wind chill close to zero in the morning. You all stay warm, too.<br />

		<p>I must be the ONLY one on the planet that didn&#8217;t watch DA!! All my friends love it as well as my daughter&#8212; I saw bits and pieces but need to watch it from the beginning&#8211; maybe a marathon viewing!! I love all the English countryside, teas and shortbread. I make homemade mincemeat pie &#8212; my husband&#8217;s favorite I just made this weekend. I even made mincemeat cookies the first time for Christmas. I have nothing to add to this  post&#8212;but I do hope everyone enjoys it as we speak!!

<em>Louvina, I CANNOT believe you haven&#8217;t watched it.  I would think you would love it.  You do need to watch it from the beginning.  </p>
<p>My mincemeat tarts were actually pretty good.  We saw Saving Mr. Banks over Christmas, and while it was good (love Tom Hanks!) it was so very sad to me.  I was expecting a comedy from the previews, and there was such a deeper and sadder tale to it than I was expecting. I think if I had known that going in, I would have liked it more.<br />

		<p>Kelly,</p>
<p>  I am not on the band wagon&#8230;yet. I haven&#8217;t watched any of the episodes. My Mother-in-law has all of the seasons on dvd which I might just have to borrow over Summer break. I always given her Barnes and Noble gift cards for Mother&#8217;s day and her birthday and I know she sometimes gets the next seasons dvds using those gift cards. If she buys books she always hands them down to me and then I pass them on to my Mom. The show looks interesting and there is plenty of buzz about it. I do love tea and drink it often. The best shortbread cookies I have ever had I made using a recipe from Martha Stewart years ago. Ina Garten also makes some wonderful shortbread cookies at Valentine&#8217;s day that she half dips in chocolate that are pretty good too. Perhaps I&#8217;ll bake some cookies tomorrow to take to work with me on Tuesday. We are off tomorrow due to snow and extreme cold. Stay warm!<br />
<em>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
I hope you get her dvd&#8217;s and watch it.  It is really good!  Thanks for reminding me of Ina&#8217;s recipe, Dawn!  I just might have to make them for next weekend.  Lucky you being off from school.  Our school system is the ONLY one open in the area tomorrow, and the windchill is supposed to be below zero in the morning.  My morning car duty will be very interesting!<br />

		<p>I am still mad at the whole show (soap opera), actually, so I won&#8217;t be watching.  I am presently all involved in Beatrix Potter, again, after receiving a new book about her at Christmas. I&#8217;ve zoomed down to Near Sawrey and Hill Top Farm on google maps, so fun! I would love to go there someday. </p>
<p>But for all of you watching DA, I hope you enjoy it along with your British snacks 🙂</p>

<em>I do know how you feel, Barbara, and if my daughter had not told me that it would be good, I too would probably not have watched.  I never thought about checking out places in Europe on googlemaps.  Duh!  What a great idea.  I will have to check that out.  Happy belated anniversary to you and your husband! 40 years is an accomplishment for which to be proud.  I am sorry your husband is sick.  Hope is gets well quickly!<br />

Great post.  I was given the tea at Christmas.  I&#8217;ll have to try some tonight.  I wouldn&#8217;t miss it.  I read enough about Matthew Stevens wanting to move on that I was able to separate the series from reality so while I was sad he left the show, I understood.<br />

<em>Hope your tea was good, Karen.  I probably should have read about the actor so that I would not be quite as upset about the end of Season 3.  The whole thing was just too tragic to me, but I am liking season 4 so far. It looks like it will be interesting to follow the different story lines again this year. I&#8217;ve not read any spoilers yet, so that is an improvement for me! LOL<br />
