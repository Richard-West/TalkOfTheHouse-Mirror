		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s amazing how a fun new lampshade can update an old lamp or change the look of a room. I got two that are very similar to the gold and cream one from Target at the top--mine have more cream and less gold in the pattern, but I love them! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,  thank you so much for showing my little raffia lamps.  Those were actually little jugs that I had made into lamps and them had the shades done in vintage fabric to match.  

Your site is really fun and so well done...I will stop by often
