		<description><![CDATA[I am enjoying this warmer weather today. Too bad it&#039;s going to feel frozen again later this week. I am so ready for warmer weather. I&#039;ve been working on springtime posts too! I have to admit, I haven&#039;t seen the movie yet. But, I love the rooms. I love blue and white! Those are the colors I&#039;m going to use in the guest bathroom. Just waiting for some warmer weather, so I can open the windows and enjoy listening to the birds as I paint!
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I did not even know it was supposed to get cold again this week.  Thanks for the update! That blue will be pretty in a bathroom, and painting with birds singing outside would be so nice.  Great idea! Looks like you are going to have to wait another week or so to have the nice sunny weather, though.
