&lt;em&gt;You are quite welcome Barb.  The Mitford books are like being with old friends...so comforting.  I can understand why you would want to read it before drifting off to sleep.

		<description><![CDATA[Read the latest Mitford book and loved it :)  I was thinking of baking an OMC, but the recipe I fund online uses 9 eggs (some whole, some yolks), while the one I saw in one of your previous posts called for only 3!  They are sooo different, I don&#039;t know which I want to use!]]></description>
