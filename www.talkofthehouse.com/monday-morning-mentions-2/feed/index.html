		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I love all your posts and this one was especially fun.  I must see this movie!  
It also is fun to follow along on Instagram.  (mitchanddianne)
Josie&#039;s Super Bowl party will be fun.  We are looking forward to Josie&#039;s Super Bowl party.  Of course, we will be pulling for the Falcons.
Your puppy is just the cutest.    I have to tell you Kathy walked my dog on a leash a couple of weeks ago.   I should have taken a picture because that is a major milestone.
I hope you have a fantastic weekend.
