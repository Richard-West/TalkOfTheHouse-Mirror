		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I would.  His style is perfectly suited to a lake house...what a beautiful lake.  Mosquitoes?  That would be a bummer, they seem to know when I am outdoors!
I love the lighting he selects and the extensive use of wood walls and ceilings.  Can&#039;t wait to see your favorites of Mr. Kettles.
Karen

&lt;em&gt;Karen – He does do other houses too, but most of what I have seen are ones he has done in homes by the lakes there in north Georgia…I was amazed to see he had done a beach house awhile back, and it was beautiful. I guess his style translates well to many vacation homes.

		<description><![CDATA[This is the first designer I&#039;ve seen that I truly thought, &quot;I wouldn&#039;t change a thing!&quot;  Our house is definitely a &quot;fall house&quot; at its core.  I still add some touches though : )
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Julianna – I’m glad you liked his rooms! Our house is a fall house too (at least right now it is.) Isn’t it funny how we can say our houses have a “season,” but it is so true!
