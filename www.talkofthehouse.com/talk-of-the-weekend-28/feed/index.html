		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t comment often enough, but wanted to pop in to say how much I enjoy your posts. It&#039;s always like reading a letter from a good friend with photos slipped inside as an additional perk.:) I was getting prescription filled in CVS a couple of weeks ago and spotted the Southern Cottage winter edition. I was thumbing through and there was your lovely home! I walked up to pay for my prescription (and the magazine) and had this urge to show it to the pharmacist and say &quot;That&#039;s my friend&#039;s home!&quot; Then I realized it would be hard to explain why a blogger that I&#039;ve never met would feel like a friend (but you do!) Thank you for always keeping it real and sharing your life with us! I have a long list of blogs in my feed, but when time is short I always go to yours first.:)

&lt;em&gt;Thank you so much Dee!  That is so funny about your magazine purchase! Yes, indeed, you should have shown it to the folks there and said you know me.  You can call me your penpal if that makes you feel any better. LOL  Thank you for reading all the random stuff here at Talk of the House.  I appreciate you!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your lovely, cheering blog Kelly! I can&#039;t tell you how I look forward to it when I see it in my inbox!  I &quot;save it&quot; for when the demands of the day are past and I can sit down with a cup of tea to savor ever &quot;bite&quot;! WE are not up to much creative here in the soggy Upstate of South Carolina! Simply running outside to attack the leaves in between rain storms! But, you are inspiring me to get thinking about how to warm up my fall decor with some reds as Thanksgiving comes along.
Thank you dear lady!
Jenny

&lt;em&gt;You are quite welcome Jenny!  I&#039;m so glad that you enjoy every &quot;bite&quot; of the posts here. :)  I hope the sun has finally come out for you and that you are having a good day doing something you enjoy.  It was foggy here all morning, but the sun has FINALLY made its appearance after its 9 day absence.  Hope you are having fun decorating for Thanksgiving.  Thank you for your very encouraging comment.  I appreciate it so much!
