		<description><![CDATA[I saw your post in Nanaland&#039;s sidebar and just had to come visit. We&#039;ve been to the Biltmore many times (and still have a home in that area) but I never get tired of seeing the photos. I always want to &#039;live&#039; in the library....extraordinary! Wonderful photos!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Wow.  I&#039;ve never been to this mansion and I&#039;m mostly impressed because of the forethought that went into building this &quot;castle&quot; during that time in history.  How fun to get to visit twice.  I&#039;ll check out the two links you&#039;ve provided.  I have this on my bucket list now!
