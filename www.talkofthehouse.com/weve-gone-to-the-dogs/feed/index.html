		<description><![CDATA[Yellow labs are the best dogs on earth.  Beau is our third and he was the biggest stinker of the bunch when he was young.  We have had labs for over 30 years.  They really aren&#039;t that bad about chewing etc.  You just have to remember that they are puppies for about three years or in Beau&#039;s case 6!! We have three yellow labs on our circle down at the lake.  One is really old, Beau is 6 and the pup is 1 1/2.  They all get along and play beautifully together.  You are going to love that dog!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;How sweet! I had already resigned myself to her &quot;puppy stage&quot; for a couple of years, so you and I are thinking the same thing.  I&#039;m glad to know that people survive that looooong puppy stage, and still love their dog afterwards. LOL  I am already loving Gabbie!  Having an inside dog is QUITE different from having one outdoors.

		<description><![CDATA[Gabby is adorable! We have two indoor labs (one yellow male, one chocolate female) and we love it! Yes, they shed like crazy and they scatter their bones all over the place but to us it is worth it. They are loving and funny and annoying sometimes. But they are a great comfort to us and a huge addition to our family. We have always had indoor dogs and we find that they are much more responsive and in tune to us than our friends who have outdoor dogs. I think you will see a difference in the way Gabby relates to you. If you can hold out until she settles down...and she will - in time. :) Best wishes to you!

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Yolie.  I am definitely seeing a difference in having an indoor dog vs. an outdoor one.  We are loving having Gabbie as part of our family!  It sounds like your dogs are an important part of yours too.  I think a lot of the readers here are pet lovers! :)
