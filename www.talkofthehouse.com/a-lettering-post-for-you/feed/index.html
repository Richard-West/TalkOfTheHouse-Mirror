		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
I love calligraphy and find I use it on everything.  It is true once you learn the basics you soon develop your own style with flourishes.  Keep lobbying for handwriting being included in the Art department it once was included in all levels of education.
For children with dyslexia cursive handwriting in forces the ability to  decode words and enhance reading.  There is a sound reason for all children to learn to write legibly, its called communication.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amen and amen!  I was talking with someone yesterday who said their daughter&#039;s teacher did not have time to teach cursive writing in their curriculum.  I can truly believe it with how much is packed in it, but, we still need to make time for it somewhere.  That is why I think the art dept. would be a good fit.  Yes, it is most definitely a skill that everyone should learn.

		<description><![CDATA[What a delightful post to stumble upon!  I love writing and hand lettering.  I use the same pens you suggested here and agree that they are the best.  Beautiful penmanship is indeed a lost art and I am always happy to know there are people like you keeping it alive!  Just this evening when I was putting up my new calendar (a real dandy from Paper Source, by the way!) I noticed there is a National Handwriting Day on January 23! Hooray for handwriting! :)
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I so agree with you Emily.  Definitely hooray for handwriting!  Our school has cursive in the third grade curriculum, but the curriculum is soooo packed with everything else that it is difficult to give it the proper amount of time that it deserves.  I have spoken with a number of people about moving it to the art department&#039;s curriculum because I think it would fit better there.  It truly is an art, and it would get more time devoted to it there.  I think I need to lobby the state department for this though, because the local board can&#039;t really do anything about a state standard.  Handwriting is definitely becoming a lost art.  I will remember to celebrate it later this month. :)
Thank you for reading and commenting!
