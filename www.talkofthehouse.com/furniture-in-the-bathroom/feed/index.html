		<description><![CDATA[Hi again! Two comments on one post!(I guess I&#039;m making up for my absence) I, too, love mint in the garden! So far I have Chocolate mint and Pineapple mint, I love them both, esp. the Pineapple because it&#039;s varigated! Do you have those as well?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Kim, Wow you did good to get those pieces of furniture in your bathrooms! We’ve been missing you around here, and I’m happy you have been able to do some catching up. I don’t have any scented geraniums, but I have looked at them in the store (and sniffed them.) I like my geraniums for a shot of red, and I like my mint in different scents…I think I have 3 varieties of them now. Thanks for coming back and leaving your nice comments here!
