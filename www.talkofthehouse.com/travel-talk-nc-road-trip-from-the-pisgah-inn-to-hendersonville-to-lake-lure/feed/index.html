		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly, I really enjoyed your NC roadtrip as I am an NC transplant now living in N Myrtle Beach.  Wilmington &#038; Southport (a must see!) are just up the road from us and we love to visit both.  Now, I am wondering if you are on your way to Charleston, my favorite city?  Happy travels!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Such a good guess Elaine!  New post up on the blog today with details of the hotel where we stayed in Charleston,  That will be followed by details of our sightseeing and dining in the city.
Have a good weekend!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I am such an NC fan girl! You have covered some of my very favorite spots, and I always love hearing about your travels--and yummy eats. I loved the Mast General Store in Valle Crucis, so I will have to make time to visit the one in Hendersonville if we get back to the area. I haven&#039;t visited Lake Lure, but it&#039;s on my travel bucket list. :) I&#039;m looking forward to your post about Wilmington. One of our twins still lives there, while the other one is now in Raleigh working on her doctorate. We love to visit Wilmington...and also take the ferry across to Southport. It&#039;s a wonderful area with some of the nicest people you&#039;ll ever meet. Great post!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thanks Amy!  Lucky you to have a child in Wilmington and get to visit there!  We have added Southport to our list of places to visit.  Thanks for the recommendation!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
