		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly ...only time for a quick comment as we&#039;re travelling at the moment! Great post! :) Just wanted to say that while I really like blue and green together and I love your blue plates! I much prefer the white plates as part of the table setting! Like you, I&#039;ll always go for plain ...it looks fresh and modern :)

&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your input Rosemary!  Fresh and modern is always the direction I want to go!  So maybe that is why I liked the white plates too. :)
Safe travels to you!
