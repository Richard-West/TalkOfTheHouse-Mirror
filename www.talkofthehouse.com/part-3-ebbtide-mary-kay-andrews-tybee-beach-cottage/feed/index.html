		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  The glassed in room is my favorite room of Ebbtide thus far! All those sweet green touches here and there! My aunt had the exact same doll house and I used to get to play with it whenever I went to my Grandma and Papa&#039;s house. I miss them so much but thank you so very much for bringing the memories of their home back to me through that doll house! I had forgotten about it and all the fun I had playing with it. The walk down to the beach looks so wonderful! I could sit on that swing all day. I just adore the beach! The sights, sounds, smells oh how amazing! Mary Kay Andrews&#039; beach house is so well decorated and inviting. Thank you for sharing it with us.]]></description>
