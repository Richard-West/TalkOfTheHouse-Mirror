		<description><![CDATA[That video was amazing!!! I loved the music and seeing your sweet family. Oh, it was just so bittersweet!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you for watching it Pam. I am so glad you enjoyed all of it â€“ the music and the photos. The end of summer IS a bittersweet time, isnâ€™t it? I guess we just need to think of the cozy months ahead.

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I love James Taylor and that song pretty much makes you think of summer.  What fun images!  As a fall/winter person I&#039;m not too sad to see summer go, but there is a relaxed comfort to the season, if it could just stay cool. :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Karen, I was wondering when someone would comment on James Taylor. Love him! (much to my childrenâ€™s aggravation.) I thought the song fit perfectly with all of it. Summer WOULD be a lot better if it would cool off â€“ but then I guess it wouldnâ€™t be summer if it did!
