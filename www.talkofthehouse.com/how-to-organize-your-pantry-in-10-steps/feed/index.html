		<description><![CDATA[Good Morning Kelly,

What a fabulous job you did and what a huge undertaking as well.
We recently moved into our new home, I am trying my best to keep a handle on the pantry.  Seems once you loose control of them, they get way out of hand and I don&#039;t want to have start all over.
Thank you for sharing your tips on how to organize a pantry as well as your time and talents with us- 
At Thoughts Of Home On Thursday.
Jemma

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Jemma!  You are so right about pantries being  a place that can get way out of hand.  I hope with a little extra effort when I get groceries that we will be able to keep ours in this state of organization.  I was delighted to share the post with the link party.  Thank you for helping to host it and for popping over!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly. It&#039;s so good to see you at Thoughts of Home on Thursday. Pantries are a constant challenge, aren&#039;t they? I&#039;m just so glad to have one now because in Oklahoma we never did. Your project turned out beautifully. You always think of every possible detail to make things perfect. :)

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Stacey.  There are a lot of good links at the Thoughts of Home on Thursday link party.  I was happy to be able to join in.  Yes, pantries seem to require a lot of upkeep - because we eat and snack so much!! LOL  I am glad you have one for all your organization.  Thank you for your sweet comment here!
