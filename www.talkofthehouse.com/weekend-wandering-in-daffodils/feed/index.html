		<description><![CDATA[Somehow I missed reading this post, but I usually scroll back in my RSS feed to make sure I&#039;ve seen everything. Yellow - my favorite color and daffodils, a sure sign of spring and one of my faves! What a feast for the eyes all these pictures were, makes me hopeful we&#039;ll be seeing some of this in New England very soon. Hope your break was a relaxing one, we aren&#039;t out until Easter. Then, it&#039;s just a matter of getting through that last quarter till June.
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I hope spring comes your way soon Paula. Your winter has been too long and too strong.  Our break has not been relaxing...VERY busy with a lot of traveling, but very fun...saw soooo many beautiful places.  
I wish we would split our break into 3 days now and 2 days at Easter.  I could use a couple of days before Easter to get things ready then.
Summer will be here before we know it.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have told so many people I want to collect all the different &quot;buttercup&quot; (that&#039;s what I call them) varieties! I&#039;m tickled you posted that Martha Stewart chart and I&#039;m going to print it and carry it with me. 
I love reading people&#039;s comments to you :) They love you!!! Like I do!

&lt;em&gt;Phyllis, I had forgotten all about them being called buttercups.  Thank you for reminding me!  Glad you liked the MS chart.  There are soooo many varieties of that cheery flower.  Thank you for your very sweet comment! (I love reading the comments too. :) )
