		<description><![CDATA[Of course you would stay at the Yacht Club.  Oh, we Coastal Dream girls!  It looks wonderful.  Love the sweet view from your balcony.  Your family are such good sports to be included in your blog shares.  Sweet Family and more memories made.  :)

&lt;em&gt;Yacht Club really was nice, and the view was really good too. Yes, more memories made.  I was just thrilled to be able to see our Seattle son and our Orlando daughter on the trip!:)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing all these great photos. 
The Yacht and Beach Clubs were high on our list when my DH and I went to WDW in November. Maybe next time!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You are quite welcome, Christi! I am so glad you enjoyed them.  I hope you get to stay in the Yacht Club on your next trip to WDW. :)
