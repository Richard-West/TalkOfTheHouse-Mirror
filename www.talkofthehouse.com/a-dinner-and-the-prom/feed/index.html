		<description><![CDATA[More comments for Kelly!!
I&#039;m SO glad I came back and saw this post!! 
What a meal! 
Your daughter is so sweet and cute and pretty. 

HOW did you write so perfectly on that chalkboard?!
And you are so pretty and young!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yay! More comments! THEY had a great meal. My husband and I had hotdogs! :) Chalkboard writing is just one of those things I do‚Ä¶I think it is like ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù. Thanks for the compliments for my daughter and me. I am FAR from young. And thank you sooooooo much for featuring me on your blog!!!
