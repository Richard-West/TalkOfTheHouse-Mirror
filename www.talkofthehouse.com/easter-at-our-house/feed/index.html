		<description><![CDATA[WOW! I must of missed this post last Easter, Everything looks wonderful. these are the kinds of Easter baskets I make my family, since my &quot;babies&quot; are now 11 &#038; 15 they no longer like the toy baskets. they usually have a book or movie request so it always gives me a theme to work with, your post gave me an idea for my newlywed sister in law and her hubby. Thanks.  it&#039;s funny or sad but I like/do a lot of the same things but my items(I do the Easter candies in bags for the teachers at my campus) don&#039;t look as nice as yours do all put together. have a blessed Easter! Thanks for the inspiration.

&lt;em&gt;Yep, these are good baskets for older kids.  I need to get to thinking on this year&#039;s baskets.  It will be Easter before we know it!  You have a blessed Easter too. Thank you for leaving your sweet comment here, Row.

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Easter! I spent my Easter on the porch at the lake house, with family and only peeks of sun. Beautiful table settings nothing says spring like daffodils and bunnies.  Hope you enjoyed your spring break, sad the weather is going to be much better next week.]]></description>
