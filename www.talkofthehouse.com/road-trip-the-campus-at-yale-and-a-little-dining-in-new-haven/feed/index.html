		<description><![CDATA[Wow Yale is so pretty what great architecture!! and great photography skills.  Your posts always make me so hungry;) lol  I just try and think of ways to make the same thing at home YUM

&lt;em&gt;Isn&#039;t the architecture just unbelievable?!  (But it really did make me think of Harry Potter. :) )  I am sorry I am making you hungry, but if you can make all the food at home that is great!

		<description><![CDATA[Those buildings are amazing.  Quite the campus!  Looks like it has a lot of wonderful eateries too.  You had me drooling by the end of this post.  Thanks for showing the menus Kelly, as I like to see what makes up the entries.  Yum!!  :)

&lt;em&gt;It was an amazing campus.  I love to read menus too, so I try to include them when I can.  It helps to know what to expect when you go to a new restaurant.  If you are near a Shake Shack, you should check them out. :)
