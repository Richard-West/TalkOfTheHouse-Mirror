		<description><![CDATA[Ok, I just read further and saw where you made the curtains. That looks like what I&#039;m going to have to do, too.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Ann, I am happy that you like the curtains!  Plaids seem to be hard to find today.  One thing I might suggest is checking Pottery Barn kids or Pottery Barn teen for their sheets.  They often have plaids, and the quality is good.  On the downside though, they are normally sold in sets, so you would end up with the fitted sheets as well...could use them to make throw pillows or other things though. I have had good luck ordering from this company, and I like this plaid..but it is not as large a scale as what we have in the bedroom.  http://www.decorativefabricsdirect.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=6135212 
Good luck with your project!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
