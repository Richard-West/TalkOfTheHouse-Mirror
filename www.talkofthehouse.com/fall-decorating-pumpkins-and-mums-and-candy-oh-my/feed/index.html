		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

I love the personal touches you add to everything. Your home looks lovely. I noticed that you used the jars for storage. Does it keep your food items fresh? Are they from Target?

Thank you for your help!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Angela.  The jars seem to keep everything fresh, but then we go through those cereals on the island very fast (and all the cookies too.)  I have not had any problems with the jars of flour and granulated sugar.  The one problem does seem to be the brown sugar.  I don&#039;t go through that ingredient very fast (except around November and December when there is more baking going on.) It seems to harden, but zapping it in the microwave does take care of that and soften it again. I purchased most of my jars at Wal-mart, and when they didn&#039;t have what I needed, Target did supply the rest. :)
