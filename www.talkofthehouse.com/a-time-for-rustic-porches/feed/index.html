&lt;em&gt;Hi Dagmar! That white porch is pretty and unusual for a rustic one. I hopped over to your beautiful porch post. I loved loved loved that last one! I should have included it in this post too! :)

		<description><![CDATA[I have to be honest, my favorite of all of them is the white porch without the wicker. I just can&#039;t help myself. So many feature those big stone fireplaces. Yum.
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Rebecca â€“ I loved that white one too as a break from all the other dark porches. It has so much character â€“ especially the ceiling. Did you notice it? So glad you liked all the stone fireplaces. I want one one day.
