		<description><![CDATA[Oh, we just love Amelia Island...we were there in April. And by chance, we came across this awesome neighborhood! You&#039;re right, you could get to the beach so fast, even ride bikes down to the beach. When I got home, I had to research to see if I could find more info on Amelia Park. The designers of Seaside and Celebration designed this sweet neighborhood! I have photos of the pink house, a lavender house and a few more faves. I didn&#039;t want to seem too much like a stalker..lol 
I was just over at your Last Song entry. Loved the movie, and found that house too when we were on Tybee :) I have much more to enjoy on your site. Thanks!

&lt;em&gt;I thought it was a very cute neighborhood too!  I am glad you ran across it on your trip to Amelia Island. And isn&#039;t Tybee just a fun beach town?! Thank you for visiting the blog here. :)

		<description><![CDATA[We most always do the model home tour somewhere. It&#039;s a great way to get decor ideas, if nothing else.  My daughter and I find ourselves critiquing the decor and snapping photos for ideas. Love the homes your Mom found, and I&#039;d be hard-pressed to pick a favorite, but the first two were contenders! Thanks for sharing your vacation with us.

&lt;em&gt;Marianne, why in the world haven&#039;t I thought about touring model homes??  You are right about getting decorating ideas there.  Glad you liked the homes in Amelia Park. It was such a cute neighborhood!
