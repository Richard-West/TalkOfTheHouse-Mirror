		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for sharing the 2007 Coastal Living Idea House and the wonderful cottages at River Dunes! We were all terribly sad to hear about the fire at the Idea House - how fortunate there are so many fabulous pictures to help us remember it. For those who might want to build their own Captain&#039;s Watch or crew cottage, the plans are available to purchase through Our Town Plans and I&#039;d be happy to talk to anyone who is interested.
Thanks,
Suzanne]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is totally unrelated to  today&#039;s entry.  I just discovered your wonderful blog, so I have gone back to your beginning blog and read every entry up to today. So inspiring and  just enjoyable to read!  I noticed all of your  baskets and wondered if you would be willing to do a post telling us where you found them and how you have used them.  I know you said you bought some of them at Target, but I&#039;m not really referring to the ones on shelves for storage--more of the ones you use for flowers, on tables, and with food. I never see the quality of baskets that you have, especially the ones that almost look like trays.  Boise, ID (where I live, but I&#039;m from MS) has a PB, but I don&#039;t see any baskets like yours there.  I would really appreciate your considering this as a topic for one or more of your blog entries.
I love your warm, inviting home, and I think the baskets contribute to its charm. 
  Thank you! Nancy

&lt;em&gt;Hi Nancy!  So glad you are enjoying the posts.  I don&#039;t think there is a whole lot more to tell other than what was in the basket post.  The ones you are referring to (the tray type) came from little shops here and there many years ago, and most are not even in business still.  My favorite one, the one in the family room on top of the piece behind the wicker chair, came from a shop in Macon, GA that I know has long gone out of business. I think this one at Tag though may be just like it. (I spray painted ours.)  http://www.tag2u.com/willow-rectangular-tray-large/202368l/product . I did just order this set from someone and am waiting on it to arrive:  http://www.ironaccents.com/109-lb8606.html .
Hope this helps!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
