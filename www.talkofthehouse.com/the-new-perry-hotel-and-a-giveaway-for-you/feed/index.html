		<description><![CDATA[Your memories of the Perry Hotel reminds me of The Hotel Utah in Salt Lake City memories that I have from my childhood.  We would always dress up, never pants, always our best and would be treated to lunch.  SLC was two hours away but my mother would take us there once a year.  We used our best manners that we had been practicing all year!!  Memories like these are truly etched in our hearts.  The hotel has been renovated into a beautiful building for parties,receptions and events for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  It is decorated beautifully for the holidays and the gardens are amazing. I have an idea!! You visit Utah and I will take you to The Joseph Smith Memorial Building and I will visit you and we will visit your Hotel Perry.]]></description>
