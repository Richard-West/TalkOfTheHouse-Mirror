		<description><![CDATA[So pretty! Did you really paint those white pumpkins? When I first saw them I thought &quot;I wish I could find white pumpkins around here.&quot;....then I read on and saw you painted them. So, I am thinking that I could buy fake orange ones and paint them. Happy Thanksgiving, Kelly!]]></description>
