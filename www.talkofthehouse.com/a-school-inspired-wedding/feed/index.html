&lt;em&gt;Julianna – I wish I had thought of it too over two decades ago. Back then though, no one did these creative ceremonies…seems like the only choices we had were traditional church wedding or the justice of the peace. Soooo many more choices today – and my daughter, being the Disney-aholic that she is says, she wants a wedding at Disney World! (Heaven help us!)

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
Love this idea... so sweet for a kindergarten teacher!  I love the kid art and using a school bus (oh does that ever bring back memories- and not comfortable ones!).
As far as using wedding ideas for my own wedding or other entertainment I have to say I have not done that.  I planned my second wedding in 3 weeks (including dress, flowers, cake and reception dinner for 10...).  When I was searching in a wedding dress shop for my dress at the beginning of June 2009 and our wedding was set for June 20th, 2009 another bride and her bridesmaids were there in an absolute panic about their short time limit to find dresses etc as she was getting married on June 30th... I was very sympathetic until I later found out that she was getting married on June 30th, 2010!!!).  Our wedding was held in the back garden of our wedding officiant&#039;s cottage set in the Rocky Mountains (I always say that the soaring evergreens that surrounded us with rays of sunshine created the most magnificent cathedral I have ever seen). 
Thanks for the interesting post, Kelly!
Cath

&lt;em&gt;Cath – 3 weeks! Oh my goodness, and I thought my 8 weeks was bad! That’s funny about the other bridal party. Soaring evergreens in the Rocky Mountains sounds like an absolutely romantic wedding site – much more so than our local Baptist church where we were married.
Thank YOU for your always interesting comments!
