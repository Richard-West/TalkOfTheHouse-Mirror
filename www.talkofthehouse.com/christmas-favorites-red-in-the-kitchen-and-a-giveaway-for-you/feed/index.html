		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm...favorite Christmas cookies? Chocolate crinkles! Or maybe Chunky Fruit Oatmeal cookies! Or Linzer tarts! Maybe jam thumbprints? Or....

I have to admit i love going to cookie swaps because of all the cookies I get to take home. Last year we had pointsetta punch (cranberry and champagane) and I made Jack &#038; Ginger cookies. Just a boxed mix but substitute the water with Jack Daniels.Then they get frosted with more Jack Daniels mixed with powdered sugar frosting. 

Your kitchen is so festive! These pictures have been the inspiration for my kitchen redo. Have the paint color for the cabinets chosen and once those are done we will replace the countertops with the butcher block ones at Lowe&#039;s and beadboard backsplashes! Love every inch of your kitchen!]]></description>
