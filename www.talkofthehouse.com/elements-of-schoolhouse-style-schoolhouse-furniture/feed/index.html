		<description><![CDATA[What a fun theme and a good question about if this style is here to stay. I suppose as us Baby Boomers age our childhood things will become desired. This post got me thinking about my first two years of elementary school that took place in a two room schoolhouse and I am not that old!! By third grade our new K-6 school had opened (and I safely walked a mile to school each day). Both schools had this sturdy wooden furniture. I have a photo of the two room school which was torn down at some point. BTW, my first grade teacher was scary but I loved my second grade one.

&lt;em&gt;Barbara â€“ That is so cool about a two room schoolhouse. Wow! I bet the wooden furniture was similar to the Restoration Hardware copies. I thought one of my elementary teachers was scary, but I am not going to say which grade. She is still around and might read this!! Ha ha. I WISH my students thought I was scary, but it is too late for that. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Another fabulous post.  I looked high and low for one of the school chairs for our granddaughter but couldn&#039;t find one that was affordable.  I think they are timeless as an accent in any home, with or without kids.  I ended up buying a knock-off at Ikea and we put her name on it, but I still on the hunt.  I loved the locker look too and have seen it used in some bedrooms, The Lettered Cottage (Layla and Kevin built their own).  Don&#039;t get me started on card catalogs!  I&#039;d love to have an authentic, old card catalog.  :-)

&lt;em&gt;Karen â€“ Thank you, I am glad you liked the post! I can usually find the little chairs around here for about $40-$50 â€“ which seems kind of high to me, but maybe the demand is keeping the price up. Lockers are impossible to find in these parts! When our old school was getting rid of their card catalogs, I wanted one so badly, but never heard when the warehouse was having them up for sale. You would think there should be a large number of them on the market with all the school and college libraries having gone to computerized systems. Hope you can find you one.
