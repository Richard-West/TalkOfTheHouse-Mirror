		<description><![CDATA[Good morning Kelly,
I&#039;m relatively new to your blog and have been reading recent posts. Yesterday I went back to the beginning I think, April 2012, and started reading. I&#039;m enjoying myself so much. A few questions now and likely more later. Maybe the answers are in the blog but I haven&#039;t seen them yet.  
You call yourself a light fanatic, lamps not overhead. I&#039;d love to be a lamp fanatic but don&#039;t like all the cords strung around and never seem to have enough outlets or to have them in the right spot. I don&#039;t see any cords in your photos, even when on furniture with backs and sides. What&#039;s the trick? 
I love all the black and white photography in the simple black frames, but even in the kitchen above the countertop and under the cabinets? I love to cook but think I&#039;m a bit to messy to make that work!
Love your style.

&lt;em&gt;You&#039;ve got a lot of reading to do then Linda!  I don&#039;t like cords either.  My cords are well hidden.  In fact when we were redoing my workroom and building a new cabinet, the outlet was not in the right place for me.  I knew where I wanted my lamp on it, and I hate a &quot;strung across&quot; cord, so I had my husband cut a hole in the counter and place an outlet inside the cabinet.  

The cord for the computer and lamp on my desk, run down the side of my desk, and the outlet is behind the drapes.  The lamp on the end table by the sofa runs down the table, under the sofa, and to an outlet in the floor that we had put in when we built and I knew it was needed there. So I don&#039;t really have a trick. I think I learned that I needed more outlets in the first house we built, so when we were putting in the electrical here, I drew out the floor plan with furniture arrangements on it, and knew where they would be needed in this house.  I would still like a hole cut in our island for the lamp there since that cord snakes around the jars of cereal. Oh wait..there is one trick.  In our bedroom on the bedside table, the cords to the lamp and phone and clock are taped to the back of the table and down the leg to the floor so that they do not hang visible behind it. :) 

Okay the photos...yes, they work in the kitchen.  I am only really messy over by the stove and cookbooks.  There are no photos over on that wall except for one, and if it gets splattered, it is very easy to wipe that glass with a paper towel and Windex.  (I also have to wipe those glass jars and the cookbook spines in that area from time to time.)  The photos by the coffee trays never seem to get splattered at all.  The biggest messy area is right behind the stove.  It really needs a piece of stainless steel there to make it easier to clean, and there are no photos in that area.

Hope that helps to answer your questions.  Thank you for reading the blog!!
