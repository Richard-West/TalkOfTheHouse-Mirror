		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful space to work in! Thank you for the step by step Advent Calendar instructions, pinned for next year:)I have many favorite bible verses but here is one that I have printed on a post-it note and stuck in the front of my bible: &quot;He is your constant source of stability; He abundantly provides safety and great wisdom, He gives ALL THIS to those who fear Him.&quot; Isaiah 33:6
Merry Christmas, Kelly!]]></description>
