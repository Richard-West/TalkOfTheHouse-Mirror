		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
You did such a great job with touches of orange, but just the right amount.  Have you cooked anything from the Momofuku cookbook? Our oldest so asked for it forChristmas one year.  I&#039;m not sure he has cooked from it ( too busy).

I love the menu on he pumpkin idea and will definitely use it soon.
Happy Halloween.
Karen

&lt;em&gt;That is so funny that your son wanted the Momofuku cookbook because the copy actually belongs to our middle son.  He has cooked one entree out of it, but I have not cooked anything from it. Glad you liked the menu on the pumpkin idea! :)
