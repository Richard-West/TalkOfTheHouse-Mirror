		<description><![CDATA[Catching up with your posts: made me a little teary to read your school lunch remembrances.  We did our family meal on Thanksgiving Eve - so on the actual day - was just me and the hubs.  I didn&#039;t rake but used the blower to pile up some leaves, and then put up my Christmas tree - quite a chore since it&#039;s all of 3 feet tall.  LOL We did enjoy some tasty leftovers and a couple of naps - so I was thankful for that day for sure.  It&#039;s just my immediate family now - all the parents and grandparents, etc.. - are gone.  So we are a smaller group but still enthusiastic for the food.  Can&#039;t wait to see your Christmas Decor.]]></description>
