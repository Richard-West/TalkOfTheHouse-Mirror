		<description><![CDATA[Kelly - I am so glad I discovered your  blog.  I read my Kindergarteners Barn Dance and Ghost Eye Tree for the second time this week.  I love both but Barn Dance is one of my absolute favorites.  I&#039;m also planning on reading Once When I was Scared this week by Helena Pittman but the same illustrator - Ted Rand (love comparing it to Ghost Eye Tree).  I loved your posts about Maine - hope to get there soon.  We were going this past summer but were so captivated by Quebec City that we never made it.  We did drive by the inn used in the Newhard series in Vermont on the way back to Albany.  Your home is beautiful, I look forward to reading more on your blog.  Donna
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Donna – I am thrilled you discovered my blog too! Ghost Eye Tree is such a fun book to read aloud. I’ll have to look for the other Ted Rand book since I am not familiar with it. Quebec City must be beautiful, but I hope that one day you get to Maine (and I hope I get there to see it in the fall one day!) How neat that you saw the old inn from that tv series. I think the final episode of Newhart has to be THE best final episode from any series ever. Thank you for reading the blog and leaving your kind comments here. I hope to hear from you again in the future!

		<description><![CDATA[I spend much time looking at posts about design concepts and also indulge in gardening ideas. I really do enjoy the simple touches most. The décor and style is one thing, but most of the style is born of the small things that are placed around. It reflects the personality of the home just as much as the major features like choice of furnishings and colour choices.
I see many like you that change things around seasonally, and it has to be said that this is what keeps a home fresh. You sure don&#039;t need to keep decorating to add or even change the character of your home. This is why I appreciate blogs like yours.
I get the impression every month is different in your home and its often so simple, inexpensive and fun to keep your home fresh and ever changing, just by changing small things. This month it’s Halloween, soon Christmas no doubt, I&#039;m sure that will be an interesting post, one to look forward too.
Then to finish I scroll down and find your Chili recipe. That finally won my heart, I love Chili. Nice read here, will be back to look again.

&lt;em&gt;Jan – Your thoughtful comments were wonderful! Thank you for taking the time to read and leave your kind words. I agree, it is the little seasonal changes that keep a home fresh. I am also glad you liked the chili recipe. Please come back to visit again. I love getting comments from my readers!
