		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly! Hope your school year is going well. It will soon be over, won&#039;t it? I fell victim to the Longaberger craze and still have 2 nieces who sell them. Now I have them hidden away. I guess I am not going to sell them to pay for my retirement, which I believed when I bought all of them! LOL! I do like the ones in your pics!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I too love baskets, and at one time, like Martha, I had my family room ceiling covered with them.  When I finally took them, and all the dust down, it was like the sun was shining! LOL! I still have some, they are so handy, but not like I did before!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Pat – I was guilty of hoarding baskets, too. When I lived in the mountains of North Georgia my apartment had sooo many (plus it was very easy to find them in all the shops around there.) I love your analogy about the sun shining in after you took them all down from the ceiling. Perfect description!
