		<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year! I really like the calmness from blue added to your rooms! It&#039;s a nice respite from all the Christmas red that will return again next month for Valentine&#039;s Day. Bath &#038; Body Works had a boxed gift set that I received from Santa Hubby (might be available online?) that would look ideal w/ your January blue-  the outside of the box is patterned w/cobalt &#038; light blue while the top of the box has a picture of white ice skates and below that, says &quot;Baby It&#039;s Cold Outside&quot;.  I&#039;m using mine to decorate this month &#038; it&#039;s quite fitting since tonight&#039;s low will dip down to -9 &#038; the high tomorrow will peak out at 4 degrees! 
Wishing you a warm &#038; cozy January!
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Good grief! 4 degrees for your high!  And I thought we were cold with a wind chill of -1!  I will have to check out the box the next time I am in Bath&amp;Body Works.  That sounds cute! Thank you for the recommendation. I used to have 2 old sleds and a pair of ice skates to use for decorations in the winter, but I believe I sold them in a yard sale a few years ago.  Stay warm!

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful, Kelly, and classy as always with you!  Happy New Year!  We had a fun evening with our closest friends.  The husband loves to cook (lucky her!) so he made us a delicious dinner then we played Wii for the rest of the night. My children got a kick out of that :)
---------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Happy New Year to you too Lisa!  I think your New Year&#039;s Eve sounds perfect.  How fun to play the Wii (and have a husband to cook!:))
