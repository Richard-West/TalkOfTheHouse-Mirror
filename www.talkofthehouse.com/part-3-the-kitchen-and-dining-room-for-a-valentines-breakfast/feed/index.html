		<description><![CDATA[You have the most beautiful handwriting. I can tell you are a teacher. You could be a professional party/event planner as well. You are so good at it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Gosh you are making me blush Michelle!  You are so sweet.  My daughter wants to be an event planner, so I will leave that field to her. :)
But thank you for the compliment!

		<description><![CDATA[I love everything about your home.  I was thinking of adding the black and white buffalo print curtain panels to my windows downstairs.  The trim is white and the walls are a soft yellow.  I have more of a French country style in my home with a good many black furnishings, as well.  Where have you found the best prices for purchasing the larger buffalo check? I am having trouble finding any as large as what you used in the study.  I am so glad you are feeling better.  I know you are happy to be retiring. Blessings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;The big black and white check is a steal and a half.  It was like $9 a yard from Ikea.  They don&#039;t sell it online, but they do carry it in stock in Atlanta.  And the fabric is wider than the normal decorator fabric sold in the US. The weight is good too.  (Those drapes are super heavy!)  I also bought it in khaki and white and will be making drapes out of it for my workroom.  You can&#039;t beat Ikea&#039;s prices.
