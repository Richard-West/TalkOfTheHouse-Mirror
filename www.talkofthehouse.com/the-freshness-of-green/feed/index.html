		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I love the open cabinets to display the plates and bowls. I never would have thought to use green, but it&#039;s really pretty! I also thought the green floor looked awesome! It&#039;s funny how a little bit of paint can change the entire look of a place. I went and saw the new Nicholas Sparks&#039; movie Safe Haven, and the main character paints her kitchen floor yellow. The only green we have to decorate with is plants, but I feel inspired to hang a green mirror - the one you showed us looks great.]]></description>
