		<description><![CDATA[Kelly - As usual your house, table settings/decorations, and meal all looked wonderful for the 4th. So many ideas to copy for future decorations or party ideas at my house. :-&#062;  As others have mentioned...I loved the red buckets. I was so excited when I saw those blue and white napkins in your red buckets though. I bought those at Target last year and have them sitting out right now on my kitchen island with my other 4th of July decorations. I am kind of proud of myself for buying something and then using it....without actually copying or replicating something you did. Great minds must think alike.  Or better yet your style is really influencing me (and my buying decisions)....like you do with so many others! Take care!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Too funny!  Yes, great minds DO think alike.  It would be a dangerous thing if I am influencing your buying decisions because glory do I love to shop!!  Thank you for your compliments.  The red buckets came from Michaels in their $1 things several years ago...in case you want to shop for them. LOL
