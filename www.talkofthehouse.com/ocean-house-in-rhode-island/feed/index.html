		<description><![CDATA[We drank Bellinis at Ocean house while gazing at Taylor Swift&#039;s home which is two mansions away. We ate lunch at Castle Hill Inn after sitting in their white addirondack chairs and watching the sailboats. While both are breathtakingly beautiful, we liked Castle Hill Inn better..... The atmosphere just seemed more low key and friendly there.
By the way, how fast &#039;til you paint the addirondack gift chair red? When my husband retried his office gave him the LL Bean red one with a brass tag attached with his name and &quot;after 33 years this old Fart deserves a rest&quot;. I kinda doubt yours says that... Heehee.
Great post.... You gotta&#039; go to Rhode Island. It is the prettiest state I have ever been in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I do believe you are trying to make me jealous...and you are succeeding!  Thank you for your input on the two resorts.  When we travel to New England late this summer, I know our time will be limited.    What a hilarious thing to put on the back of the chair.  Mine says something that could be funny too.  Our school mascot is a cougar, so it says I will &quot;always be a cougar!&quot; :)  I haven&#039;t decided what color to paint it yet, but red has been in my head for it awhile now.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, 
This was lovely.  The original hotel reminded me of the movie, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;.  And the first fireplace stones reminded me of my grandmother&#039;s lake home in Michigan.  Such lovely tours you give us.
You must have many mixed feelings about no longer teaching.  But you must have made that decision for a reason and you will use your many talents to bless lots of people, just like you do now.
So many of us are enriched by the words and photos you share.  Many times over this past year or so as many difficult things needed to be taken care of I would open your posts and they would transport me to places far away.  Places of beauty, and culture, and peace, and loveliness.  And afterwards I would be refreshed to deal with the next challenges in my days.  So see, you never know how you are touching people out here in blogland.  Most all of those issues and illnesses in the lives of people that needed my time and energy and abilities have been dealt with.  For that I am most grateful, but your regular posts played their part in blessing me and reminding me that a beautiful world still was &#039;out there&#039; as I walked through that time.  So thank you, dear Kelly, smile through your tears....you have been a blessing to many.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Joan, it has taken me awhile to get through my back-up of emails from the last couple of weeks, but I wanted to thank you so much for your very kind and uplifting comment here.  You are right.  We never know how many people we are touching in our life in what we do.  I am so thankful (and blessed!) that whatever it is that I do here was helpful and a blessing for you - especially in what must have been a stressful and difficult time.  I hope that all that stress has been resolved for good and that you can simply enjoy the posts here without having to go back and deal with issues.  We are all just pebbles tossed in the water and our ripple effects just go on and on.  I hope you have a fabulous Friday AND a wonderful weekend! :)
Take care!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
