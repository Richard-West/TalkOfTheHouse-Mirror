		<description><![CDATA[Your blog is always such a source of inspiration -- you always make me think more about the importance of details.  I also soak up inspiration from Pinterest, antique shops and flea markets.  

I love the blue and green together -- so fresh and just a little different!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Kim. :)  I soak up a lot from Pinterest as well!  (Sometimes it is overwhelming though!)
Glad you liked this spring&#039;s color scheme. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my, Charlie and Kiddie Lit!!!!  That sure brought back a memory or two!!!  I tooo get inspiration from children&#039;s literature!!  I particularly love the watercolors of Jerry Pinkney.  Your home always looks lovely no matter how you arrange it.  I sure wish I had your decorating energy.   Happy Spring!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Aren&#039;t children&#039;s books just wonderful?! I met Jerry Pinkney at a conference I attended a number of years ago and got him to autograph my copy of The Little Match Girl.  His artwork is beautiful!  Happy Spring to you too Linda!
