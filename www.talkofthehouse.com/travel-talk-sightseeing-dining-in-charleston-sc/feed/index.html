		<description><![CDATA[I love Charleston!  It&#039;s such a fun city to walk around and the tours are wonderful. When we stayed there we were at Two Meeting Street Inn; the white house with round porch and looks like a wedding cake! It&#039;s so pretty and across the park. Poogan&#039;s porch is a favorite of mine to dine.

Also, I love the beaches there...Isle of Palms is wonderful! You need to make another trip to see everything!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;We do need to make another trip...a long one!  And I need to add all of your suggestions to our itinerary next time.
Thanks for all the recommendations Robin!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
We ate at Husk last year about this time without a reservation. We waited out front and checked as soon as they opened. They seated us on the porch which was lovely. The meal was delicious. Maybe they sometimes leave an open table or two. There are so many choices for wonderful dining in Charleston you can hardly go wrong with most of them. 
I have enjoyed your rememberances of Charleston.
