		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t tell you how much I am enjoying your blog since finding it yesterday, I love your turkey plates. I just remembered that I have two similar ones in a box in the garage I will have to look for. My few Thanksgiving decorations get stored in between the Halloween ones. it is another  gray rainy morning in Fl, but I am dying to drag my husband over to Winter Park to the WS store just to browse, though I do have a long list of spices I need from the Penzy&#039;s store just down the block from there.  Hope you have a wonderful Sunday!]]></description>
