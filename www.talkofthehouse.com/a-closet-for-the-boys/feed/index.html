		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  The boy&#039;s closet looks really nice. The inspiration look very nice too but they are all bigger so I really think you did a great job with the space you had to work with. We have built two personal houses in 14 years and I have to say the closets are never big enough. Thanks for sharing!

&lt;em&gt;Thanks Dawn.  I think the size of our closets is pretty good. I would just like MORE closets.  If I were building again, I would put in a closet that is solely for linens, and I would build a &quot;party pantry&quot; to house trays, serving platters, etc. as part of the kitchen. Maybe one day...:)
