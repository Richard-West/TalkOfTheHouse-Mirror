		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I came across the girls room on Pinterest while looking for bunk bed ideas. Just gorgeous! Where can I find this bunk bed? Or could you tell me who makes it? I would be grateful if you could help. Thank you! -Jill
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Jill, I am afraid we bought those bunkbeds maybe 10 years ago?? at a local furniture store.  They were on closeout and a steal at $400 for the set.  I did have to paint them because they were a yellow-y cream color.  I&#039;m sorry, but I do not know who manufactured them.  Pottery Barn Kids&#039; Catalina bunkbed set is very similar (and on sale right now.)  http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/catalina-bunk-bed/?pkey=cbunk-beds&amp;  Good luck with your purchase.  Sorry I can&#039;t be of more help.:(
