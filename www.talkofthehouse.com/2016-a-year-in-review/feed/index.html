		<description><![CDATA[I was reading the 2016 year in review and I love the Brownie recipe wall. Would you share the pie recipe at the bottom. Rich&#039;s the wonderful old Atlanta department store served a chocolate chest pie that was wonderful, and I wondered if it was similar? I haven&#039;t had one since. 

Looking forward to 2017.
