		<description><![CDATA[Welcome to blogland!  You&#039;re off to such a great start!  Love the idea you had about the runner - I&#039;m going to use that next time we have a shower!  Can&#039;t wait to see more posts from you - I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all in for a treat!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your sweet words Katie! I love using the paper runner at parties. It works great for wedding showers AND for baby showers too (writing parenting advice). So glad you stopped in for a visit today!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly! When did this happen?! I didn&#039;t realize your blog was up and running. My mom actually told me about it....she told me to check out a blog that she found on Tessa&#039;s through the comments, low and behold it was you. anyway, welcome! I&#039;m off to look through your other post now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth, SO glad you found me! I just took the blog out of ‚Äúconstruction mode‚Äù last Wed., so please tell your mom thanks for sending you over. I emailed a few people to tell them it was up and going, but I have a hard time with ‚Äúself-promotion.‚Äù (A blog in itself IS self promoting, but telling others about it just has not gotten into my nature yet‚Ä¶haven‚Äôt even told my friends and family around here yet. :) ) I ended up doing all the customization myself on a Prophotoblogs template. I love Prophoto, but don‚Äôt love that you can‚Äôt have threaded comments‚Ä¶so my comment to you is below my comment to Tessa. Maybe prophoto will add that one day. Anyway, thanks for reading and jumping in the conversation!
kelly
p.s. Thanks also for the follow on Pinterest. I have been pinning your stuff for awhile now‚Ä¶so you will see some of the same stuff! (Great minds think alike!)&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
