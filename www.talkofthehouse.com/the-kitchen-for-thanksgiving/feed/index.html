		<description><![CDATA[Just finally taking a break from holiday preparations and of course I was eager to see if you had posted.  How do you find the time?  I had  to giggle a bit when I saw your table, as mine is similar to yours.  I stumbled upon a large white ceramic turkey on clearance at JoAnn Fabrics 2 weeks ago and what a score at $8.  Then I was able find some new linen color cloth napkins at Target on sale as well. I usually have two large cylinder candle holders all the time on our harvest table.  I left those in the middle as well and just placed a few mini pumpkin gourds.  Done.  Those green plates are wonderful.  Love all your other touches in the kitchen, especially the beverage area.  Can&#039;t wait for you to post your hot holiday punch recipe.  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family Kelly.]]></description>
