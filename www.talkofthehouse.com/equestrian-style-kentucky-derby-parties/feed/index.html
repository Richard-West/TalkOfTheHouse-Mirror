		<description><![CDATA[Well I sure missed reading your last two posts.  My family and I went on a little holiday southbound!  Kelly, I too like all things equestrian.  Must be because of the plaid which features all red and green.  I will take a peak at the blogs.  There is much eye candy here for sure.  Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My uncle used to show horses. I have always loved them, but have never learned to ride. My sister in-law and niece ride. We have the land to have some horses, but...I will have to keep dreaming and enjoy the neighbors horses. So many ways to decorate with horses. It doesn&#039;t have to all be western with cowboys. I love the more elegant ways to decorate with horses. 
I read Shirley&#039;s comment about the emails. I&#039;m not having any problems with that, but I have had some Wordpress readers that have told me they can&#039;t leave a comment and there is one blog I can&#039;t leave a comment on. I think it is on Wordpress&#039; end. So frustrating.]]></description>
