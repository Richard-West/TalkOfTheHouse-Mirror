		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly...That dip looks deee..lishish!!!! It&#039;s a keeper for sure especially since my hubby is allergic to chocolate (poor soul). This will be the perfect substitute. Loved your centerpiece!!!! Your boys are so very blessed to have such a wonderful Mom!!! Happy Mother&#039;s Day by the way. My daughter is at Disney World as I write, having the time of her life. I know you are looking forward to having your sweet girl back home again. Thank you for another 
great post. Blessings!

&lt;em&gt;That dip IS a keeper Gail.  How awful that your husband is allergic to chocolate.  I would die!! Thank you for the compliment on the centerpiece.  
Happy Mother&#039;s Day to you too.  Hope your daughter is having a super fun time WDW.  She is there at a great time...perfect weather, and hopefully not the peak crowds of a month ago.  Yes, I will be thrilled to have our daughter back home. :)
