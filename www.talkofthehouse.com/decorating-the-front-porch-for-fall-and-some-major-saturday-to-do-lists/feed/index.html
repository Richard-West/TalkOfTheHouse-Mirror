		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Kelly. I have already told you how I spent the weekend. I would much rather have spent the time scrubbing something/anything.  LOL! I love the beams on your front porch ceiling. Happy Accident is what I would call that. I also like the white mums. The pumpkins and mums look so welcoming on your steps. I haven&#039;t heard of the movie. The trailer looks like a movie our family will love. Thanks for sharing it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I know.  Being at the hospital is scary, so yes, scrubbing would have been MUCH better.  Thank you for the compliments on the beams.  They are a vast improvement over the mess that was hanging up there.  The movie was great.  I hope you get to see it.
