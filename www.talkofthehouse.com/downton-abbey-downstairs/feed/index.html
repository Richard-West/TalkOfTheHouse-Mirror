		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE Downton Abbey! My husband and I just happened on it one Sunday night after church and was hooked for a season. My daughter bought us season 1&#038;2 for our birthdays last year and season 3 for my birthday this year. I waited until I was recouping from surgery in February to do a DA marathon. I was very sad at the 3rd season ending but will continue watching when the next season is out on DVD. I love all the characters! Each add so much to the show with their individual personalities but my favorite thing about this show is how the servants are treated. They are almost part of the family and included in different occasions. For those of you who have not watched DA you really must, you are missing out on a real treat.

&lt;em&gt;Oooohhh a marathon!  How fun!  (Hope your surgery wasn&#039;t serious.)  Yes, season 3 was VERY sad.  You will like the end of season 4 I think.  That is a good point about how the servants are treated.  I had not thought of that, and it does really add to the show. Thank you for reading and leaving your comment, Lorrie.

		<description><![CDATA[I too was horrified by the end of season 3.  However, in the interim I&#039;ve read and watched many interviews with Julian Fellowes (creator, writer and director of DA) where he explained in great detail what happened.  The guy who played Matthew refused to come back for any more seasons.  They begged the actor to come back even for a few episodes or even 1 episode in season 4 so they wouldn&#039;t have to kill him at the end of 3 (remember in England each season finale is played on Christmas so all of England had to watch his death on Christmas for Pete&#039;s sake!) - but he refused. Julian did not want to &quot;break them up&quot; as they had a true love story and would not have divorced - so he had no choice but to kill the character.  It&#039;s 100% the fault of the actor (which is so ridiculous in my opinion.  I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll never hear of him again. Arrogance.) - but I&#039;m not holding it against the show.  Loved the episode Sunday night - can&#039;t wait for the next however-many Sundays.  It requires tea each week for sure.  Shortbread is super-easy to bake. Love, love love the show!  Great blog post - I love that kitchen!

&lt;em&gt;Thank you for all the information, Elle.  I had known that Dan Stevens wanted to leave the show, but I did not realize how unreasonable he had been about it.  I can&#039;t understand WHY he would want to leave when the show has such a wonderful following and he had such a fabulous role in it.  Oh well, I thought Sunday night&#039;s episode was great even without him. :) Looking forward to the coming episodes, too.
