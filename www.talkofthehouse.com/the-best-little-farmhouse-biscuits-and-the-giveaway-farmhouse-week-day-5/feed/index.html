		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kelly,
I make the biscuits that you have posted above, too. My recipe is called Sour Cream Muffins. The only difference is that my recipe calls for 1 1/2 sticks of margarine or butter and 2 cups of self-rising flour. This would be helpful if someone did not have Bisquick in their pantry. And, yes, I make biscuits - perhaps too often! I pat the dough out and cut them with a biscuit cutter. Steve loves Muscadine Preserves from Callaway Gardens. Now I need to get him some Muscadine Sauce!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The biscuits are in the oven as I type. I&#039;ve never had the muscadine sauce either....actually I&#039;ve never been to Callaway either and I&#039;ve lived in GA all my life. 

When I do biscuits they are drop style and recipe from the box :)
