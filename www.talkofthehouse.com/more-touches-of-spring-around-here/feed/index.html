		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Thank you everyone for all the suggestions for cleaning my streaky mirror!  I am going to embark on a massive experiment with all your suggestions to see if any of them will work on it...starting with the microfiber cloths suggested by Susie and Dawn, and then trying the vinegar recommended by Nancy and Maureen, then the ammonia from Jerri, and all the products suggested by both Lindas, Yarlette, Cindy, and Pat Pegram. Maybe Dayle and Pat would like to try an experiment with all of it too. :)
