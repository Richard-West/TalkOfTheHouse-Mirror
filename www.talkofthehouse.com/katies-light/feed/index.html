		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, thanks for this story. I have been friends with the Caples my whole life and was fortunate enough to call Katie my first friend. We went on to share many lovely memories in this home and the one after where Susan and David live today... I too think it is a magical place and I thank you for calling it for what it really it. 
Katie was one of the MOST special people I have ever been able to call my friend and since we had been friends for my whole childhood until her tragic death its always comforting to see Katie&#039;s Light and to think back on all the great times we shared.

My Best!

&lt;em&gt;Erin, I am horribly slow in answering emails (obviously!) but I wanted to thank you for your comment.  You were very lucky to have Katie for a friend and be a part of the Caples&#039; lives.  It was so terribly sad what happened to Katie, but I think it is positively wonderful what has happened to honor her memory. We should all be so lucky to be remembered in such a powerful way after we are gone.  I understand that the Caples sold Elizabeth Pointe Lodge earlier this year.  It just won&#039;t be the same without them there!  I hope the new owners are not making too many changes to the magical place that it too was.  
Thank you again!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I just found this post! My husband and I vacationed here at Elizabeth Pointe Lodge back in 2009. We attended a Bed and Breakfast weekend seminar that David Caples and his assistant put on. It was an enjoyable experience. The stay and Breakfast was delicious, and you get a tour to see how everything is done to run their business.

I did not know about their daughter and that you could rent Katie&#039;s Light and the Miller cottage if you have children with you. they are such wonderful people!

Thank you so much for posting this!
Robin

&lt;em&gt;I have always wanted to do one of those seminars, but I don&#039;t think my husband would ever consider running a bed and breakfast.  The Caples are wonderful.  I am so glad you found and enjoyed the post, Robin.
Hope you get to go back to ELP soon!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
