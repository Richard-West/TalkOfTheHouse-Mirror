		<description><![CDATA[I love all of the chalkboards you have displayed in your beautiful home. How many different chalkboards do you have and where do you buy them? I love the green color of the frames pictured in this post. Did you paint them yourself? If so, what&#039;s the name and brand you used. I just adore your site!
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you, Ashley!  How many?  Um..let&#039;s see...There is one large one from Pottery Barn in the playroom, and one small one in there from Hobby Lobby.  There is a small one over the desk in the kitchen, also from Pottery Barn, and there is the long one on the porch from Pottery Barn.  I did paint the frames of the ones in the playroom, and the color is Moss - a Laura Ashley paint from Lowes. Then I added some black brush strokes to give it a more shabby chic look. 
I am glad you are enjoying the blog! Please visit again. :)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, that looks delicious!  However, my hubby and son would never eat it because of the mushroom soup.  Could I use something else you think? ;)
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;There appears to be a good substitute for it at this site, and it does not have the mushrooms...so I am not sure how the flavor of that &quot;gravy&quot; would be. It would be worth a try though:  http://southernfood.about.com/od/ingredientsubstitutions/r/bl90911a4.htm I think if I were going to do it this way, I would dice all the ham and put it as a layer on the bottom of the casserole instead of rolling it up in the chicken.  That way it would give the sauce more flavor.  You would simply need to be sure you ladle out some of the ham with the sauce on top of the chicken when you serve it...might actually taste better that way! :)
