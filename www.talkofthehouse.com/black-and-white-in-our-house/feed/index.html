		<description><![CDATA[It looks fantastic! I love all the touches you have. But then, I just love looking at your house no matter what is in it!! :-) I love how you have different but related paneling in each room. It just works so well!!

I did have one question -- you have this great feature in your feed where the images are smaller. Is that a plugin that does that? It&#039;s very cool. A great compromise over truncating a feed.

&lt;em&gt;hmmm..Angela I am clueless on that.  It must be some kind of setting that I don&#039;t know about...not sure.  Tech things are like a foreign language to me!&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aunt Kelly, I love the black and white! I&#039;m so used to seeing at least a splash of red in the house, but I really like what you&#039;ve done without it. Especially the oreos and the &quot;Not all who wander are lost&quot; quote! :) However, I cannot wait to see the house for Valentine&#039;s Day. Hope all is well.
