		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Great job.  I love the little touches of Valentine &quot;love&quot; you&#039;ve displayed.  So fresh and sweet.
Hope you don&#039;t loose power.  It&#039;s sure been an unusual winter for the nation, SoCal with spring/summer-like weather since Christmas and the south with weather normally associated with the northeast.  
Crazy.

&lt;em&gt;It HAS been quite a crazy winter.  I am happy that you liked all the Valentine details.  Given that I am a teacher, this had to be one of the easiest themes for me to pull off. :) Glad that you have made it back home to your newly finished floors!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Any chance you remember what the drapery fabric is in your bedroom?
Happy valentines Day!
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Kate, I am afraid I don&#039;t remember.  I bought that fabric in blue for the bedroom, green for the master bath, and red for the kitchen and dining room.  I loved it!  (Wish I had purchased it in yellow as well.)  I went back to order more of it several years later, and the mill that manufactured it had closed.  So I don&#039;t think you will be able to find it.  And now my fabric store that originally ordered it for me has also closed.  I have to travel 2 hours to Atlanta to find fabric these days.  Not good.
