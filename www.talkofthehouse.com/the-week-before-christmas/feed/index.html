		<description><![CDATA[This is a delightful post. Such a creative way to share your wonderful Christmas with us. It is like an extra Christmas gift for your readers! Thank you! Just wish I could have grabbed one of those special favors from the shower. I am happy for you. It is definitely obvious great memories were made. I am looking forward to 2016 Talk of the House!
