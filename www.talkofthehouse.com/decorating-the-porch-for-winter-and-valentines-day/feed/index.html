		<description><![CDATA[Prayers said for your father-in-law, Kelly! I am so glad you had the wonderful birthday celebration for him. I love your snowy/wintery porch with the cute chalkboard and the sled centerpiece but I do not want that groundhog to see his shadow. I am through with snow and winter and ready for springtime and the beach!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thanks Kathy.  My father in law made it home from the hospital over the weekend and seems to be doing well.  We appreciate the prayers sooooo much. :)
I thought it was going to be cloudy here today, but no...it is sunny...and the groundhog has seen his shadow here. :)  We have no chance of snow for sure through the 15th.  I guess we will have to drive to the mountains in order to see some.
Have a terrific Tuesday!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
The  little sled is adorable in your centerpiece and I bet your husband loved getting rid of the words with his new sander.  Men can become quite helpful with projects with a new power tool.   The porch is inviting and beautiful.   I hope your father in law&#039;s health improves.   
Have a great week!
DiAnne

&lt;em&gt;Thank you so much DiAnne.  My father in law came home over the weekend.  
I need to learn to use those power tools so that I do not have to rely on my husband&#039;s skills.  I wonder if I could build some furniture....hmmm....:)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
