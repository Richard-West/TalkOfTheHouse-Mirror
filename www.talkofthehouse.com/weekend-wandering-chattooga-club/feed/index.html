		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  Thank you so much for the beautiful Spring like pictures! I need them right now. It is snowing here, again. We have 2 inches already and are looking at several more. I am so ready for warmer weather and Spring like trees, grass and flowers! It&#039;s Easter next weekend and I think I might have to go get some tights for my daughter to wear with her Easter dress and sandals. Oh well. I will appreciate the Spring greens when they finally go get here! Hope you had a great weekend!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Dawn â€“ Goodness, I wanted some snow this year, but it seems like you have had never-ending snow! Even I would be quite tired of it by now. And Easter with snow seems strange to me. I am glad I could give you a peek at some spring time through the computer images. :) I do hope your spring time arrives soon! (I know when our awful summer heat hits here full force, I will be wanting some of your winter weather.) Stay warm!

		<description><![CDATA[If you like the Chattooga Club then you should check out the Eseeola Lodge in Linville, NC.  It is a little further north in the NC mountains.  We currently have a house in Highlands, NC but now living in Charlotte, Linville is only 2 hours away instead of over 3 for Highlands.  So we will be building there starting this spring.  The Chattooga Club style is exactly what we will be doing- bark outside and horizontal plank walls throughout the interior.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Teresa â€“ We have been to Linville Falls, but I cannot believe I have never heard of Eseeola Lodge before. Thanks to your email, I checked it out. It IS beautiful! And yes, we would love to stay there (and you donâ€™t have to be a member!) Your new home sounds like it will be gorgeous â€“ and exactly like something I would love to build. I am jealous!! Thanks for the travel information.
