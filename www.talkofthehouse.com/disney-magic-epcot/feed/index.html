		<description><![CDATA[Oh Epcot!  It looked wonderful and that food too!  Ugh!  I won&#039;t dare share this post with my third daughter.  Epcot is a bit of a sore subject at our home, (more like an tease).  Years ago my sister and I took the two youngest, (of my four children) to Disney World.  It was June and we were only there for four days/3 nights.  Well, trying to cram as much as we could in, we did not make it to Epcot.  I have not heard the end of it from my daughter.  She wanted to go to Epcot the third night and I chose to take the kids back to Magic Kingdom for more rides and the evening parade.  There is so much there and besides having our room at the Caribbean, with the pool to utilize.  Have been to both Disneyland and Disney World, twice.  It was years ago, when they were small.  America&#039;s treasures.  Your daughter is so lucky to be there. The fact that you live close enough, being in the south, makes it a little more convenient.  Lucky family!
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, your daughter is right.  Epcot needs to be seen!  I do understand wanting to see more rides and parades at the Magic Kingdom though.  Our daughter is certainly lucky to be there - although she had a small fender bender there a week or so ago. She does NOT like the traffic. But with that many people traveling there, it is to be expected.

		<description><![CDATA[How beautiful! Even though WDW &#038; all its properties are practically in my backyard (about 40 miles away) we rarely get to go. Some day, when I win the lottery, I want to go and pull out all the stops! A few years ago, we did get to go at the holidays and took the launch from Disney World to the Grand Floridian to see the life size gingerbread house in their atrium. So gorgeous! After being to other area theme parks,  no one does it better than Disney. They really have cornered the market on hospitality. 

If you ever get to the beaches in the area, let me know. I just got back from our beautiful Playalinda beach a few minutes ago!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You are THAT close, and you rarely go Jane??  Man.  I am glad you got to see the gingerbread house at Christmas.  I hope I get to do that one year (and see all their holiday decorations in the park.)  I will let you know if we get to the beaches near you, and I will check out Playalinda.
