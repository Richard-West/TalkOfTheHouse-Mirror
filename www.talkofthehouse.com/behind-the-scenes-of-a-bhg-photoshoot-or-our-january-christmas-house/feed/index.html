		<description><![CDATA[I just don&#039;t think I can barely wait until the BHG issue comes out with your fabulous house and all your attention to detail! It will be like waiting for a new Downton Abbey season to start!! I can certainly understand why they thought your house had &quot;so much material&quot;. 
I have your father in law on my heart! I am glad you were able to entertain with all the fixings after Christmas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Katrina. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers. :)
