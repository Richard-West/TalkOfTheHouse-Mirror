		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

Great post...love all the photos!  I have the pendants in the last, yellow kitchen over my island.  I love the look but unfortunately they don&#039;t put off enough light on their own.  The electrician suggested adding can lights to supplement, but I added a lamp on the counter instead...at least for now.  My favorite kitchen is the cream one with the cantaloupe and doughnuts on the counter...take care!
