		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

I love your site!  I don&#039;t get to comment as much as I&#039;d like, but wanted you to know that I turned to your site to help with a dinner party I was throwing.  I wanted decorating ideas for the table and recipes.  Thanks so much for sharing all of your pictures with us.  It&#039;s a great help, plus, some days, it&#039;s just a much needed place to go to day dream!  :)

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, 
Your home is always pretty, no matter the season or celebration.  I really like the yellow accents for spring/summer.
The herb/flower garden is really pretty with the contrasting vibrant green grass! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="ðŸ˜Š" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f33f.png" alt="ðŸŒ¿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f331.png" alt="ðŸŒ±" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f33e.png" alt="ðŸŒ¾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
