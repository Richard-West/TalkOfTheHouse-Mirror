		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for being a part of Best Of the Nest!  This is just so pretty AS USUAL!  I just go my new issue of BH&#038;G and its all about yellow on the cover.  You must be a happy person to be around!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank YOU for hosting it!  Yellow is such a happy color to be around.  I couldn&#039;t resist using it. But after seeing some of the blue fabrics you have posted lately, I am craving some blue now.
