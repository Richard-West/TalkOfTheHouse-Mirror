		<description><![CDATA[You have a gift! Everything you touch turns out beautifully! I must tell you I love all your chalkboards and what you write on them. Can you please tell me how you do all the different fonts? My handwriting is hideous, but I&#039;d love to be able to write on my chalkboards like you do!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Kelly!! I&#039;m just now getting to read this post, and I think THIS is my favorite room. I don&#039;t know why, maybe it&#039;s that it&#039;s something different than eveything else out there. I&#039;m really thinking I&#039;ll have to incorporate some black/white/green into my decorating next year. Thank you for sharing your whole house with us this season. Everything was so beautiful!!

&lt;em&gt;Missy – It IS different from most everything you see for Christmas. The chalkboards are why I like it(plus my love of black and white gingham.) I was glad to share the house here this year. I just hate I ran out of time before showing you the great room with the mantle and our main Christmas tree. I am so happy you liked it all.
