		<description><![CDATA[You brought back so many pleasant memories! Many years ago Daphne Lodge became one of our favorite places to eat...the atmosphere and food can&#039;t be beat.

We passed by it a few weeks ago and commented that we needed to eat there soon.

One of our dear young friends proposed to his wife to be on the front porch...

Happy Eating...Betty

&lt;em&gt;Yes, you need to go back there and enjoy a meal soon Betty!  You are so right.  You can&#039;t beat the atmosphere and the food..and then you need to drive around the lake while you are there.  It has become our weekend fun trip!
How romantic for your friend.  I hope she said yes! :)
