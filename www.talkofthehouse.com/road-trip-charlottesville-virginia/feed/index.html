		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I am loving this trip.  I have been to Charlottesville but it was a long time ago when we visited Monticello.  Now, I want to go back.
Have you heard about Mountain Faith Band on the tv show America&#039;s Got Talent.They are from our small town of Sylva, NC and have made it to the semi-finals.  We are so proud they are shining such a bright, positive light on Western North Carolina.   Tune in if you can tomorrow night.  
I can&#039;t wait for your posts about New Haven.

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  What a fun city to visit! We have been there for a night on our way to vacation before and just one night visit including dinner and hotel was not enough. I hope to get back that way some day and will absolutely have to visit Public Fish and Oyster. The food looks and sounds amazing. When we stayed there we had Italian at a restaurant name Bella. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
