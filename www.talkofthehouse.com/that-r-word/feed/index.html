		<description><![CDATA[Kelly - Congratulations on your retirement.  I am sure there are a lot of emotions going on for you - both happy and sad.  I am sure that you were a wonderful teacher and will definitely be missed.  Selfishly I am happy though....because I have become such a fan of your blog and you that I am hoping this means more time for &quot;us&quot;. :-&#062;  Good luck with everything!  Sarah
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Sarah.  Yes, I hope to get more done with the blog now that school is no longer occupying my time.  I&#039;m so glad you are enjoying the blog!

		<description><![CDATA[So thoughtful of you to prepare such a nice spread for your teacher friends. Teacher friends are the best ever. When you count the hours you spend as much time with them as your family. Bittersweet  to watch that last bus pull out.
Your future has endless possibilities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;They are like family, and I have probably spent more waking time with them than my family from August through May. (sad huh?)  It was definitely bittersweet to watch that last bus.  I was sitting alone on the steps and our newly hired teacher (who will start work next year) came up and said, &quot;You doing okay?&quot; (She was really concerned.) I just shook my head because I did not want to cry.
I hope you are right about the endless possibilities...or at least a few new possibilities. :) My retirement check is going to need some help!
