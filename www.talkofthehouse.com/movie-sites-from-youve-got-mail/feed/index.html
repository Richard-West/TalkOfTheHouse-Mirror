		<description><![CDATA[One destination I want to go to is the park where they met.  I found the address for it on line once.  I am sure I could find it again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I wish we had visited that park as well.  I know it would have been lovely.  Here is a link to its location if you would like it:  http://youvegotmail.warnerbros.com/cmp/tour-garden.html

		<description><![CDATA[Reading this post brought back many memories.  I am a second grade teacher who also travelled to Columbia for their writing class.  My colleague and I discovered Cafe Lalo and visited a couple of times to sample the sweets!   Thanks for the reminder!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am so glad you were able to enjoy Café Lalo too, Connie.  I wish we had something like that little café her in our town, or at least within driving distance.
Thank you for reading and leaving your comment. I appreciate it!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
