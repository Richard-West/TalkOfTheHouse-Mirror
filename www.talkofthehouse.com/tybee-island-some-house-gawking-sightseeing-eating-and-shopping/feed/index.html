		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, again thanks so much for the birthday surprise, I&#039; m still celebrating the big &quot;60&quot; one week later. As you know - I am a devoted fan and think the world of your blog. What more can I say, it was serendipity that I&#039;d be the winner on the 13th! Someday I will visit Tybee along with so many of the other wonderful places you take us to via this amazing blog.
