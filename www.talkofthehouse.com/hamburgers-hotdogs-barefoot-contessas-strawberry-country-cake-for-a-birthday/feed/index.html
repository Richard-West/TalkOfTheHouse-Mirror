		<description><![CDATA[Well that&#039;s it!  You should do some online birthday decorating advice because you just bring it all together and make it look effortless.  Your mom should feel very special.  A happy belated birthday from Canada!  If I remember, I think I shall make a square birthday cake like this one for my husband&#039;s and daughter&#039;s birthdays in July.
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Ha ha..very funny!  I don&#039;t think I could fit another thing on my plate here.  I will pass on your belated b-day wishes to my mom.  thanks!  I thought the square cake pans made it look better.  July will be a great time to make that cake.  Your family should love it!

		<description><![CDATA[Now I know where you get the good genes....from your mom.  She is very pretty and young looking, just like you are!  My daddy always wants strawberry shortcake for his May birthday.  I like how it looks made in the square pans. (My daughter named my mom Geebeejimba so when I have grandchildren I think I will have them call me GeeBee.)
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;What a kind compliment for both me and my mom!  My mom is tall and has always liked to drink milk and exercise - sadly neither of which apply to me. LOL Geebeejimba - what a name!!!!  It&#039;s fun to pronounce, but I do think I like GeeBee better (definitely easier to say.)
