		<description><![CDATA[I love this post! As you know, I am so about the beach! I would love to stay at this cottage for a month...or longer! The shabby chic painted furniture there inspires me to go paint something then distress it. The blues and greens were perfect! I also loved that you read a Mary Kay Andrews book while there. What a way to relax after that fabulous graduation party!]]></description>
