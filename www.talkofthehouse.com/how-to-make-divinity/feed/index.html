		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,  I fell in love with your picture frames and am now on the hunt to buy them locally.  I have seen some at Walmart and Michaels but can you please tell me what size you frame is and the size of the picture used inside. The large ones seem to be a common size.  I may attempt to cut my own matts out of very thin paper.  Thank you so much. Your house is just beautiful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Forgot to mention, I too have the same mixer.  Funny story,  I have always wanted a Kitchen Aide mixer but for some reason rationalized that I shouldn&#039;t get one because I probably wouldn&#039;t use it that much.    Anyway, so this fall I attended a bridal shower where a young twenty something received  a mixer.  I left that shower thinking, why does a twenty something own a Kitchen Aide mixer and I don&#039;t.   Soon after I bought myself one.  It is so easy to use and I have used it sooo much.   The lesson here is Life is short so don&#039;t wait around to get yourself a Kitchen Aiide Mixer.]]></description>
