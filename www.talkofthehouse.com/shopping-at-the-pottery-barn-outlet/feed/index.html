		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Kelly.  I hope you are feeling much better.  Don&#039;t go back to work if you are not completely well.  I love that Pottery Barn Outlet and the Williams Sonoma Outlet there as well. I can be to Dawsonville in about two hours and fifteen minutes from my house if I don&#039;t stop.  It is always worth the drive. I can also be at the PB Outlet in Gaffney in about an hour and a half.  I like going to Georgia better though.  I do not shop on Black Friday.  It brings out the worst in me. So, I loved this little mini trip.  I went back and looked at the post again with the flute music playing.  And, I love cheesecake.  Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma and cheesecake!  Could it be any better!!!]]></description>
