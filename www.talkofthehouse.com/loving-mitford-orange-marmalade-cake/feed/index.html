		<description><![CDATA[I have never read the stories. I had never heard of it until I saw this event. I am not a big reader, but confess that your blog has left me with a curiosity that may have to satisfied. Since the library is hosting this event, I can&#039;t help but assume that they have at least some of the books in this series. I may read one and then have an excuse to take the trip!
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;YES your library will have all the books.  Go start with At Home in Mitford.  You will be hooked!
Enjoy!

		<description><![CDATA[I found this site while trying to find out about Mitford. Our local library is having a &quot;Taste of Mitford&quot; to honor those who contribute. I clicked your link and read about your visit. Lovely visions! It makes me want to experience the town. Thank you for the wonderful read.
PS&#062;&#062; Nothing wrong with going overboard on things!

&lt;em&gt;What a fun event at your library Anna Mae!  If you are a Mitford fan, you would love a trip to Blowing Rock. :) I&#039;m so glad you found your way to the post.  I hope you will visit again. :)
Thank you for your comment.
