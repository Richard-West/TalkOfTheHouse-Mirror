		<description><![CDATA[I love the look of this version.  And the Sea Nest is adorable.  I&#039;d love a dining area with windows wrapped on two sides.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am sold on that dining room too!  Can you ever have too many windows? :)  And I am glad you like the houseplan Carolyn.

		<description><![CDATA[I really like this version and the rooms with the wood. Amazing ceiling painted like wood and the bathroom lights, too. Different! The green cabinets I think would be great combined with nature and the setting for a cabin. I love the look of the house as well, but not sure what color. Just me talking, hope you find the right one. No harm in dreaming, right?!  :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your input on the choices Karen. :)  Who knows if we will ever get to make this dream house a reality, but you are so right.  There is no harm in dreaming. Thanks for dreaming right along with me! :)
