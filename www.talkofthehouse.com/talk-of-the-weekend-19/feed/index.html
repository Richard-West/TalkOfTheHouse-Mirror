		<description><![CDATA[This gets me so excited for Summer vacation.  My parents rent a 10 bedroom house every year and take the 22 of us (my sisters and their families) and it is the greatest week!  Can&#039;t wait for Jan Karon&#039;s new bookâ€¦it&#039;s going to be amazing!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;22 of you! Wow!  And yes, you would need a 10 bedroom house for that many, but then the house could actually be a hotel!
I too can&#039;t wait for the new Mitford book.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
