		<description><![CDATA[Lovely homes! I so enjoy just driving around in historic neighborhoods and looking at all th eye candy. My daughter lived in Tallahassee for the past 5 years and we enjoyed driving up to Thomasville a few times. We always eat at Jonah&#039;s (which I highly recommend) and had cupcakes from Small Cakes. They are so delish! We were there a few weeks ago and I had a sangria cupcake...oh my! That was our last trip for a while since she is moving to Europe. She leaves on Friday! There are some quaint shops and beautiful homes there. Have a lovely day!

Hugs, Vicky

&lt;em&gt;Congratulations on your daughter getting to see Europe - up close and personal! :) Strangely enough, I have never been to Thomasville, but I hope to go there this fall.  The Annie Moses Band is performing there, and I hope to see the concert.  I looked at Jonah&#039;s menu, and it looks fabulous with quite an extensive range of entrees (and appetizers!) We just might eat there before the concert. Yum!
