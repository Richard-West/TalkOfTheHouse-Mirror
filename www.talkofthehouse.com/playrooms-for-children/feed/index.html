		<description><![CDATA[Oh, and I should mention that I just found your blog by clicking on your comment on &quot;The Inspired Room&quot;... just so you know.  I will be your newest follower.  :)

&lt;em&gt;Lisa â€“ I am so glad Melissaâ€™s blog led you over here!! I used to teach 1st grade for many years. I think that is the most important grade in all of school. An old school desk in your living room would be such a neat touch and a great thing to have for homework. Thank you for reading and leaving your sweet words!
Please do come back to visit again.
