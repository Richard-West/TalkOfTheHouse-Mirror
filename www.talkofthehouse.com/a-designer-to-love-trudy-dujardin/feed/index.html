		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know who is playing the piano, but the music is 
Claude Debussy&#039;s &quot;Clair de Lune&quot;.
Signed,
another pianist :^)
PS: this designer does some lovely stuff...she just needs to get reacquainted with RED :^)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, I remember playing that piece many many years ago in a piano recital. I think it must be required of all piano students!LOL  I don&#039;t see much red in Trudy Dujardin&#039;s repertoire, but I too think it would be a nice accent in some of her rooms.

		<description><![CDATA[Perfect post this morning.  So relaxing and calming.  Those rooms are gorgeous.  Oh Nantucket.. never have been, but you have my heart!  Loved your ending video.  Call me silly, but I purchased several cd&#039;s years ago that have coastal wave sounds with music as well as nature sound ones too.  I have just been playing the coastal one recently in the kitchen as I start my day with &quot;CALM&quot;.  I will need to order this book, as I have a Barnes and Noble 20% coupon waiting to be used.  Thank you for this lovey post.  Gonna stay in a coastal state of mind all summer, even if I don&#039;t have a beach a block away...........Sigh!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I&#039;m so glad you found them relaxing Debra.  I am like you ...never been but still smitten with the island.  No, you are not silly to be listening to the nature music cd&#039;s.  I have a stack of about 10 of them in the cabinet myself. :) Your Barnes and Noble coupon would be put to good use with the book I think.
Stay in that coastal state of mind all summer if you can!
