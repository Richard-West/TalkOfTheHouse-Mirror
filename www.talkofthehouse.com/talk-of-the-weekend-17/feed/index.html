		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I love Italian food and several of the dishes you showed us made me hungry!  We have been invited to a friend&#039;s house for Valentine&#039;s Day, along with 2 other couples.  I&#039;m responsible for making the salad...your caprese salad won me over.  How cute to have mozzarella cut like hearts.  I love it! 

That restaurant you showed looks amazing.
Enjoy your week.
Karen
