		<description><![CDATA[We go to The Outer Banks each summer and rent a LARGE home as there are usually 22 of us. So we need a bunk room for the little boys, and a bunk room for the little girls, and then usually 7 master bedrroms with their own bathrooms. It is wonderful and we organize it so that each family has a day and does breakfast, lunch and dinner. BUT, then you are DONE for the week. It works out great! This is a beautiful home too. Thanks for sharing it!!!

&lt;em&gt;22!!!  Oh my goooooodness!  You need an entire inn. :)  That sounds like a wonderful vacation.  I think you all should see about renting this gorgeous place for the week. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
While this home is beautiful, I think it&#039;s far too large for me, unless there were servants! lol
What a view.  Maybe they&#039;ll change it to a bed and breakfast when they&#039;re older and no longer use it often. :-)
