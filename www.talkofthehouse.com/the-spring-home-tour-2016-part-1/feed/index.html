		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t help but notice your countertop. Did you make these yourself?  I love wood counters and would like to make some if possible. Lovely home and I especially like the buffalo check!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Hi BJ!  Yes, my husband built the countertops from pine shelving boards.  They have quite a few coats of polyurethane on them to help protect them from water.  I&#039;m so glad you like them and the buffalo checked curtains.  
Have a great weekend!
