		<description><![CDATA[Your home always looks so warm and inviting. I look forward to see how you&#039;ll decorate for the change of seasons, holidays, birthdays and anniversaries. I don&#039;t know how you find the time to do it. My friends and I laugh that we have less time to get things now that we&#039;ve retired than we did when we were working. Thank you for taking the time to write your blog and share your life with us.]]></description>
