		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly
Love your playroom and your touches of green.  I had the exact same experience with a painting I bought about 10 years ago.  It started in the living room where I painted and replaced every stick of furniture and over 2 years expanded to every room in the house.  It was definitely &quot;If You Give a Mouse a Cookie&quot; and that&#039;s exactly how I explained it to everyone!  Love that you used the same &quot;explanation&quot;.
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;How funny!  Yes, that book perfectly explains what happens in decorating when one decision affects another which affects another. :) It goes round and round!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, What a beautiful room.  I too am in the process of updating our kids playroom into mre of a &quot;big kid&#039;s&quot; playroom.  I have been searching for art work and love your chalk board quote.  Can you tell me what&#039;s written on the last line?  Thanks so much!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Allison, that very last line is a quote by Michael Jordan that says, &quot;So play. Have fun. Enjoy the game.&quot;
