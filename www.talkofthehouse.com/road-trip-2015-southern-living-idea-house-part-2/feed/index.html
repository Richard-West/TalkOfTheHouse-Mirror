		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m one that isn&#039;t crazy about the decor, but I do love the house itself.  I agree with a previous poster;  How would Kelly have decorated this?  I DO love the Master bath and closet.  I love that soaker tub and have a wish for one in my bath.  Awwww, but no room.  Dream away.  Thanks for the Part 2, Kelly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Those soaking tubs do make you dream about them, don&#039;t they?  The ultimate in relaxation. :)  I love my clawfoot tub and a looooong hot bath.  In your next home, you need to be sure to put in a big bathtub Kaye Ann. It is fun to dream about what we could do to personalize a space for our own style.  Lots of possibilities in that house!

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful architecture love the elements of stone, siding, metal roof all fab. The interior design completely baffles me. The kitchen and butlers pantry have the most potential but to be honest I was disappointed. That said I appreciate the efforts you put forth to visit and share with us your readers. I too prefer your style
picked up a copy of Southern Cottage last week - your home is just charming Kelly.

&lt;em&gt;I think we would all take the exterior in a heartbeat.  It looks like a home that has age and character. That butler&#039;s pantry appeals to a different type of homeowner I think.  At my age, I need all the light I can get in order to see well! LOL  
Thank you for getting a copy of Southern Cottage.  We were shocked to see that one on the newsstand!  It is a reprint/rework of an article from Cottages and Bungalows from FOUR years ago.  I never would have known about it if a reader had not alerted me to it being in it. Thank you for the sweet compliment about our home Victoria.
