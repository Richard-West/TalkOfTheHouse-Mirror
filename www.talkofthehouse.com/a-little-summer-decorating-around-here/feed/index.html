		<description><![CDATA[Hi there Kelly,
Elaine Heron here from way across the pond in England. Very exciting day here today, waiting for Kate&#039;s baby to be born but, still time to check out your website and, any new ideas I might find for the home we are fixing up!
I started to look at your website about 2 months ago, and was really taken with your lovely ideas. You live in a wonderful part of the USA, and I am quite envious of the beautiful area surrounding your home.
English homes tend to be a &quot;lot&quot; smaller than Americian homes ( wish I had the space you had!) but the ideas still come thiick and  fast  When I check out your updates. You have a lovely knack of making small changes that really look special. We have &quot;nearly &quot; finished 2 rooms out of 7, still a way to go. However I don&#039;t mind because it gives me time to change my mind, and check out what you have done! I have given your website to a few friends too and they love it. 
Keep inspiring, and I will keep up the English interest over here
Elaine Heron

&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s a boy!! Any predictions for the royal name?  I am leaning towards Phillip as one of them. It would be so fun to be in England today.  :)  Thank you for popping over with your extremely kind words, Elaine.  I love it!  Good luck with the home you are fixing up.  I am so glad that you can find some inspiration here, and thank you for passing on the website info to your friends.  I appreciate any and all readers that come my way!  Please do stop by again.  
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
