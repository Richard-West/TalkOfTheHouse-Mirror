		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly, thanks for stopping by &#038; checking out my home renovation. It is going to be a major project, but I&#039;m so excited.  Cumberland Mall is not that far from me, same side of town.  Do you live in ATL too?  

I love what I see on your blog already, you are off to a great start.  I hope you enjoy your blog journey as much as I have. It has truly changed my life in SO many ways!!  Take care &#038; hope to see you again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Wow Rhoda! Thank you for taking the time to stop by! I know your renovation is keeping you and your family hopping. No, I am not in Atlanta…a couple of hours away. The traffic of Atlanta scares me, and I am amazed that my son can handle it. Thank you for the compliment on my blog. I’ll be checking up on your home redo again soon.
Take care!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
