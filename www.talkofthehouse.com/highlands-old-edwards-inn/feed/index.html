		<description><![CDATA[The area is lovely, but what happens if the business closes. Too many are getting too big and cost prohibitive for the average vacationer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Jo – That is such a good point. If it closed, it would certainly make it hard on the town since so much of it is invested in Highlands. I had not even thought about it from that standpoint. Based on all the magazine reviews of it, it doesn’t look like that is a problem for any time soon though. Thanks for your comment!

		<description><![CDATA[Hummmm....so hard to decide. I love having quant little places to stay, but then again...I hate seeing something online and thinking, &#039;Oh that&#039;s so cute.&#039; and then you get there and the place is falling apart. I&#039;m in eastern Tennessee, so The Highlands is so easy for us to get to. I love having a really nice place just a few hours away. It&#039;s so hard to find that around here, but I DO want to still be able to afford it....ok, obviously, I have no answer whatsoever. HA!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Missy – Your comment made me laugh out loud! It IS hard to decide which side of the fence to be on. It is nice, but like you, I still want to be able to afford to enjoy it. Maybe we are asking for too much!
