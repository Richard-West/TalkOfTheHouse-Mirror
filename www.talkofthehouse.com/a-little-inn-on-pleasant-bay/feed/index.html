		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, a friend of mine recently found your blog and told me to check it out. I love your style! Love your posts with all the photos. I&#039;m glad or see that you love some color, buffalo checks, and even furnishings that are not all painted grey :). I&#039;ve really enjoyed going through your older posts and catching up with all you have done on your home! Looking forward to following you this summer...Warmly, Gracia]]></description>
