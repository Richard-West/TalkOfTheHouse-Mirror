		<description><![CDATA[I was reading back through some of your posts, and this one caught my eye. Lets not talk about jars. I use them for everything. My pantry is full of them for everything under the sun!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;They are so useful and more attractive than any packaging...but goodness they are addictive!!  Sounds like you belong to our jar-lovers-anonymous club, Lori. :)

		<description><![CDATA[I got so busy that I missed part 3, and when I found it today, I had to go back to part 1 and 2, you know, just to maintain order!  I love it all -  your jars, your clocks, your chalkboards, your flags, your red, white and blue!!   Gorgeous!
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, you must maintain continuity! Too funny!  Glad you enjoyed all of the Summer Home Tour.  It will be time for autumn before we know it, won&#039;t it??
Thank you for reading Susan.
