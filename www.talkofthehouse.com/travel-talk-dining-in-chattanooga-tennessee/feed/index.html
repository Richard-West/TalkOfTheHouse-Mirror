		<description><![CDATA[Just getting here to the party! Oh my stars, I think I would love to do a food tour there!  My mouth was watering the whole time I read. 
I love Chicken Picatta, and make it maybe once a month...so easy. I use Ina Garten&#039;s recipe.  It isn&#039;t topped like the one you had though, but that sounds easy to copy.  
I gave up making fried chicken years ago. I hated cleaning up the splatters all over the kitchen. Tried it once about a year ago, and quickly remembered why I don&#039;t make it!  ;-)  Now we just pick it up at the supermarket, and it&#039;s delicious because I didn&#039;t have to make it!  I once got undercooked fried chicken at a restaurant years ago, so I shy away from it when dining out.  Funny how things happen that affect you for years.  
Thanks for the fall trip! Dang cold here tonight!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, a food tour is definitely in order for there!  Yum to your chicken dish. :)
Bad food experiences will certainly turn you off from dishes (and restaurants!) 
VERY cold here as well!  Stay warm.

		<description><![CDATA[Tupelo Honey started here in Asheville, and is always good, but I tend to always get the same things. Their sweet potato pancakes are wonderful, and the recipe is in the first cookbook.  My sweet husband often makes them for me on Sunday mornings, baking the sweet potato the night before.

&lt;em&gt;That sounds delicious Carolyn, and your husband sounds like a sweetheart for making them for you!
Thank you for stopping by. :)
