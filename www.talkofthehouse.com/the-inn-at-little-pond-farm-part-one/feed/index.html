		<description><![CDATA[Love some of the possible pojects in your home.  I am especially interested in the large plate rack in the room with the long farm table.  Do you have a pattern for the plate rack that you will share?  I have a small dining room and would like to save room with something like this, as well as make a statement.  Thanks, Carol]]></description>
