		<description><![CDATA[Yet another thing we have in common, log houses or cabins!  I recently got the DIY channel and I am hooked on Barnwood Builders...love the program and all the crew.  
I like the remodeled red kitchen, the first one was way to busy for me. Fun to visit but I wouldn&#039;t want to live there.  
We finally saw the sun on Tuesday in North Carolina, you are so right first couple of days of rain were cozy, but it got old fast.
As always thanks for sharing, Cindy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;We almost bought a log cabin years ago, but the sellers would not take a contingency sale contract.  Everything worked out for the best for us, but I still love old cabins. 
Yes, that rain got old...and dark...and depressing.  I know you were just as happy as I was to see that sunshine this week!
