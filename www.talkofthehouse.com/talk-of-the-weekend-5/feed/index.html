		<description><![CDATA[I love random! It can be so refreshing, don&#039;t you think? Thanks for sharing it all! I think I will try that chicken recipe too! Looks great. I use an old lotion bottle with a squirt top for my dish soap in the kitchen. A couple of pumps keeps me from over using the soap. The porch sunset was beautiful! I love to sit in our front porch swing and watch it set. You should come join me sometime! Fall and winter are best, because the leaves are off the trees and you can actually see the sun set. haha. We can build a bon fire and sip on some hot chocolate! ;)

&lt;em&gt;An old lotion bottle is a great idea Jayne! It would be fun to watch a sunset from a front porch swing...a nice and relaxing way to wind down the day.  I am ready for some cool weather in which to enjoy a bon fire and some hot cocoa.

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly:  Put clear Dawn (help clean the oil soaked ducks) in a clear wine bottle, size of your choice and add a pour spout.
Looks great on the sink.  From our friend, Martha Stewart.

Keep writing and inspiring us!

&lt;em&gt;I remember them using Dawn on those poor animals with the Exxon disaster.  The wine bottle with pour spout is a good idea...guess I need to really thank Martha for that. :)
Thank you for your sweet comment.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
