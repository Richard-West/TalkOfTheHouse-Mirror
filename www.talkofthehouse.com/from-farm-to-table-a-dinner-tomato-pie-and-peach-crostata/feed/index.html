		<description><![CDATA[I made both the peach crostata and the tomato pie this week since peaches and tomatoes are so plentiful right now in our midwest farmers markets. Both were so delicious. Thanks Kelly for the recipes! Tomato pie was a first for me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yay!  I&#039;m so glad you tried out BOTH recipes Faye!  And I am also happy that I could introduce you to the wonderful tomato pie.  As a tomato fan, it is one of my favorites!  
Happy eating this weekend. :)

&lt;em&gt;I hope you found what you needed for the meal at your market!  I would love a plate of fried okra right now myself! :)
