		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for putting all of the Valentine ideas into one post. Very clever! Now I can just pin them all onto a Pinterest board. My favorite things are your tags and ideas for favors. When I get my Valentine cookies from Cynthia, I will send you a photo. Maybe you will be showing us your Valentine cookies next year. I hope your week was fun and you enjoy your Valentine dinner. My husband and I were going to go to Atlanta for the weekend but decided to wait for a warmer weekend which is fine with me. (I would rather be angry than cold!) My husband is going to cook for me. Congratulations to Kaye Ann! Happy Birthday to Louvina! and, Happy Valentine&#039;s Day to you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love all your red and white Valentine&#039;s Decor. :) Your table settings are always my favorite. Your lucky guests! I&#039;m not a big fan, but I do have a little red and even a little pink (my mother-in-laws&#039;s vintage mixer and some &#060;3 cookies cutters) spread around a few spots. :) Hope you have a wonderful dinner with your guests and your romantic one with your husband. ;) Seems like I remember his birthday might be on Valentine&#039;s or close maybe. :) Oh, and I loved your past two house posts!!]]></description>
