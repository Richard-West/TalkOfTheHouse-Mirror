		<description><![CDATA[Your house is so cute! I will be decorating the outside tomorrow. It will be the warmest day of the week at a whopping 57 degrees. We do like to put up lights. We do it differently every year. Have no idea how we are going to do it this year. It may depend on how many light still work. haha. I need for my husband to hurry up and put the railing on the porch back up. Then I could put the garland and bows back up. Oh well. I&#039;ll think of something! Merry Christmas!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi sweet Kelly, your home is beautiful for Christmas!!  Your greenery looks real!  Love the pinecones and cheery red.  Heeney&#039;s in Atl has nice fake greenery.  I add real greens from Home Depot&#039;s scraps.  Our exterior lights are white with colored as accents.  One of our traditions is to fix hot chocolate-to-go and drive around the neighborhoods at night.  Love seeing all the lights.  Also to make gingerbread houses!  Loved yours!  And your hot chocolate tray is brilliant.  Thank you for sharing all your beauty and inspiration.  Many blessings to you and your family and merry Christmas!]]></description>
