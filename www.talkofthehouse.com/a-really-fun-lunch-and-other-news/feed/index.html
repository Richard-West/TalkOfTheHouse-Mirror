		<description><![CDATA[So fun that you two southern belles got to get together.  What a wonderful spread greeted her!  Loved seeing anything James Farmer!  Hope you are enjoying your retirement so far!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It was a lot of fun Cindy!  I was thrilled to have Holly here with her friends for lunch.  I want to get out to James&#039; house and take some photos - but he may not allow photography now :(...probably saving it for a magazine feature or a book. Retirement has been busy...hoping it will slow down some! Hope your summer is going well so far.

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto on everything that has been said but also,......you find the best videos to share!  Perfect advice for your  &quot;parent to be&quot; friend.
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;This is the first baby(babies) for my friend and she was feeling a little overwhelmed with the thought of having two little ones to care for, so I thought that sweet video was perfect for her. I am glad you enjoyed it too Vicki.
