		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, i admit I have a closet addiction. There is nothing I like better than being organized. I like the closets with the cubbies vs the drawers.  One day I would like to get my closet re done. I am lucky to have a big walk in closet but the space is not being utilized as it should be. I keep looking at closet organizers at Lowes but I really want a closet like the ones you showed us!!A girl can dream.
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, a girl can most definitely dream!  It sounds like you have good ideas and plans for yours.  That&#039;s a great first step. :)
