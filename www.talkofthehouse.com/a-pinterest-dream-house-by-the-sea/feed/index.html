&lt;em&gt;Yes, Melissa you would be kicking and screaming the whole way as we drag you, right? ha ha. I really do think that I would be happy with just the pool house. Do you think those folks would even notice me out there?

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I love this house!  I want to live here!!!!  What a cool idea too to do a post on building a &quot;imaginary&quot; house.  I agree with you on the style too, I&#039;ve always loved these &quot;Hamptons&quot; style houses.  They&#039;re so beautiful and feel unique.  Coastal, but still so classy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Lindsay just bring your stuff, and we will all move in! This style has always been my favoriteâ€¦makes me think I am going to have to move to New England one day. Coastal and classy â€“ thatâ€™s a good way to describe them.
