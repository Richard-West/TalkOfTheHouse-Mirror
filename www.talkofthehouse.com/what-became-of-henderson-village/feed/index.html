		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  The grounds look very inviting but the restaurant stole my heart. It looks so cozy. The menu has many yummy looking foods on it too. Make sure you keep us posted on your return trips! I love fried catfish. Thanks for sharing.

&lt;em&gt;It is cozy, Dawn!  And I will keep you posted on future trips.  I promise not to leave the camera battery in the charger next time. :)
