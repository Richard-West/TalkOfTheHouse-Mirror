		<description><![CDATA[What a great date night! It&#039;s a shame that it&#039;s for sale. I hope a great investor gets a hold of it!

&lt;em&gt;Thanks Elizabeth. I too hope that someone who is a great investor with a love for old homes will buy the place. If I had the money I would!

		<description><![CDATA[Yay!  I&#039;m so glad you guys found time to go out for a nice dinner.  Lately, Brian and I have been frequenting our local Home Depot but in less than two weeks we&#039;ll be here: http://www.thesanderling.com/spa/treatments/ :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Aimee, you lucky girl! I love the Outer Banks. Duck has such a different vibe from the rest of it (I like it the best.) And the lobby in the Sanderling Inn is gorgeous. I know Home Depot will miss your business, but too bad. I know you will have a fabulous time. Iâ€™m jealous!
