		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
There are not enough words to tell you how thankful we are for all the compliments and kind words about Ashley and Phillip&#039;s wedding. You played one of the main roles in getting this wedding ceremony on the right track with your willingness to help Ashley with her invitations and addressing all the envelopes. We enjoyed every minute preparing for her wedding. You know that I do not have the vision that Ashley and Steve have. But with their creatively, everyone&#039;s help, and all my running around and baking, the wedding was &quot;perfect!&quot; We appreciate you!
Janna
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Janna – You do not have to thank me. It was my pleasure – remember I LOVE weddings! And this one was beautiful AND fun.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
