		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
The cracker jack cones are so tempting and sound pretty doable.  I know most of my family would love to have these so I may be trying my hand at your recipe later this summer.
Thanks,
Karen

&lt;em&gt;Karen, I think everyone would love them.  I hope you do get to try them out.  If you don&#039;t do the ice cream, at least do the cones.  They would be good with many flavors of ice cream.

Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That looks like a lot of work but the reward would be great, I imagine. ;)

&lt;em&gt;There were a lot of steps to it,but yes it was worth it.  If it is sweet and has chocolate, I don&#039;t mind the work at all!
