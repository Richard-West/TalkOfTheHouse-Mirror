		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly! I JUST got back from the PNW yesterday - was in Bellevue for a conference! It&#039;s very weird to be a visitor in your own home - took some great pictures of the few remaining places in town I recognized. If you haven&#039;t had dinner at The Beach House in Kirkland, make sure to add it to your stops. Back to heat and humidity today - what a change. Looks as if you and your &quot;boys&quot; had a superb visit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Aw you could have gone by to visit our son, Susie!  That would be so strange to be at a conference in your own home town.  We have not been to The Beach House, but I will pass your recommendation along to our son who I know will be more than happy to check it out. :)  Hope we can too on our next visit.
Yes, the humidity is in full force here.  Who needs a sauna when Mother Nature provides one the instant you walk outside?  Thank goodness for air conditioning!
