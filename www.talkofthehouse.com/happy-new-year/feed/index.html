		<description><![CDATA[So lovely to be able to reflect back over your year like this Kelly. Thanks for sharing it with us ..I&#039;ve really enjoyed reading it.
Hope you&#039;re having a lovely weekend. We&#039;ve had a dusting of snow but it&#039;s just wet now which is disappointing. Meeting up with the family later for lunch though, which will certainly brighten the day! :)

&lt;em&gt;Oh how I wish we would get some snow this year...even a light dusting would be so nice.  We did not get one single flake last winter.  Fingers crossed for this year (although according to the long range forecast we will have temps in the sixties until the end of the month.)  Your Sunday lunch sounds nice!  Enjoy the time with your family, and thank you for stopping by Rosemary! :)

		<description><![CDATA[Is that a full calendar, the one that looks like a chalkboard? I love that. Target, or someplace else? 

Lovely setting. :-)
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, Carole it IS a full year&#039;s calendar, and I did get it in Target...either $1 or $3 right at the front in the &quot;dollar bin&quot; type area.
