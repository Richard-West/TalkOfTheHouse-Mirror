		<description><![CDATA[Love all these great ideas and the table setting is perfect! You have got to be the most creative person ever! I have the same &#039;little red boots&#039; ornament from Target and I keep it out all year long. It&#039;s just too cute to put away! :)
Great post as always!
Amy

&lt;em&gt;Thank you so much Amy!  Aren&#039;t those little boots the cutest thing?!  I wish I had bought more of them.  I waited until the after Christmas sale, and there were only 2 left at that point. I think that is a great idea that you leave them out all year.  I might just have to copy you on that!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
You should be a photo/product stylist for Pottery Barn!   Such a great post.  I live in Sylva, NC. (Kathy&#039;s neighbor).  I loved to go to Antipasto&#039;s Restaurant and am sorry it closed.  I agree with Kathy, you would love Lulu&#039;s in Sylva if you ever find yourself in these parts.
I am ready for spring!
DiAnne
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh that would be such a FUN job, DiAnne!  Glad you liked the Valentine&#039;s post.  You live in a beautiful area of this country.  I will definitely give Lulu&#039;s a try the next time we are in Sylva.  Thank you for leaving your comment here!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
