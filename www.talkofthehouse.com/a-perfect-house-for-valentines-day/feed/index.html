		<description><![CDATA[I love all of the white with pops of red!  That section of the garage with the leather chairs makes me smile.  My dad made a bar very similar to that one for our daughter&#039;s wedding.  (We still have it in our garage.) We also finished the walls with bead board.  So, now I am thinking of putting my husband&#039;s leather chair and tv out there...not really, because there would not be room for even one car. BTW, I have been meaning to tell you how much I love that you comment about a photo &quot;before&quot; the photo instead of after.  That way, I know what to look for in the photo following your comment instead of having to back up like with some blogs.  (Thank you!)

&lt;em&gt;Everyone needs a bar and leather chair in their garage,right? LOL  I am glad you like the comment before the photo, and your thinking is exactly why I do it that way (great minds think alike!)
