		<description><![CDATA[Years ago we enjoyed a delicious split pea soup at the Iroquois Hotel.  We have yet to experience any other as good. It was served with a swirl of sour cream ? on top and maybe a crouton...not sure but it was absolutely fantastic !!!  I would love to get the recipe!  We will be visiting the Island mid June, hope someone has the recipe now.
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That sounds delicious Barb.  Perhaps you could write the hotel to see if they could share the recipe with you.  I know you will enjoy your trip this summer.  You are lucky to visit such a wonderful place!

		<description><![CDATA[I have always wanted to stay at the Grand Hotel but this other smaller hotel looks so amazing....I just may have changed my mind!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Me too Shirley, but this smaller one is definitely more our style so it will be our choice when we make a trip to that magical island.
Have a blessed Easter weekend!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
