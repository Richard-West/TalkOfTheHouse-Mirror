		<description><![CDATA[Love the red! I use a lot of red in my home. My kitchen walls are a buttery yellow and I have a black &#038; white checked back splash with red (mostly cherries) accents.  The family room next to it has the same yellow walls and a red checked couch. I have had it for years and have never tired of it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Kelly!

  This looks right up my alley! My favorite bedroom is the one with the window seat so I can sit and read in it! I love areas like this. We spent a few days in Asheville, NC last year on our way to Surfside SC for vacation. Asheville is wonderful! I could live at Biltmore Estates for sure. I would love to stay there again but during the Fall instead of the summer this time. Thanks for sharing The Little Pond Farm with us! It is now added to my &quot;Places to Visit&quot; list!]]></description>
