		<description><![CDATA[These are all so pretty. We added a wrap around porch to our house about 10 years ago. It is now my favorite part of the house. We also changed our floor to ceiling windows in the front (old house-big leaky problems) to double french doors. We live in the boonies so they are thrown open all the time!As for wicker, I now prefer brown. For some reason I really like hunter green cushions with brown.(That&#039;s not what I have, though.) Not so in vogue now, but I love that campy look!

&lt;em&gt;Oh Pam, double French doors would be pretty, but I would have a hard time giving up floor to ceiling windows (especially when you have a high ceiling!) I bet your wrap around porch is beautiful, and having the doors thrown open sounds fun. Our French doors stay open a lot, but they only open to the screened porch. Speaking of campy, when we lived in a rental, our living room furniture was the porch wicker painted hunter green, and the cushions were upholstered in red tartan plaidâ€¦.very campy. Worked great for Christmas!

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, Kelly...where to begin?  These are amazing porches!  I LOVE the comfortable vibe of #8 (reminds me of my parents&#039; in South Carolina). I also adore the last one, but yeah...how does that swing work, exactly? :)

&lt;em&gt;Aimee I think #8 is amazing too! The house it is from is so beautiful. If that porch is similar to your parentsâ€™, then they must have a pretty porch! Thanks for stopping by.
