		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry you are sick! Good thing you went to the doctor because pneumonia is scary and can be deadly! I used to not think so, but we almost lost our grandson to it and I will never take it lightly again. So please follow doctors order and get better quickly!
I so enjoy your blog and I thank you for sharing your lovely home with all of us! I can&#039;t wait to see your Christmas decorating! You always have such great ideas!]]></description>
