		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, hope this finds you feeling better.  Loved the photos of the Pottery Barn outlet - definitely must go when next we visit out son and his family in Atlanta.  But had to comment, my daughter was a music major, her instrument was her voice.  I sure remember all the concerts, all the tears and what joy to look back on it.  She has two daughters now and we go to their concerts - oldest plays the cello and is in the chorus (middle school).  Good times ahead.  You will never regret rearranging your schedule for yet another time for one more concert.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope you are over your cold, and that your Thanksgiving weekend has been filled with peace and enjoyment with family and friends. I am grateful for the gift of good health as I have a protracted but relatively easy rehab from knee surgery. I am also grateful for the wonderful family I have around me, as well as the friends who have given me so much support these past few weeks. Loving the piano recital heard in the background as I type. I think, Kelly, that you do have the best blog followers, it is always a pleasure to keep here to read your posts and then to enjoy all the comments as well. Here&#039;s to sailing through the next few weeks of school and seasonal festivities (mayhem)!]]></description>
