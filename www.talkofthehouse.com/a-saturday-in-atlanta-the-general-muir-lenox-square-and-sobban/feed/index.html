		<description><![CDATA[Looks like you had a wonderful time in Atlanta. I remember going to downtown ATL to shop when I was a little girl. That was before malls. I haven&#039;t been to Atlanta in quite a while. I love the bunny plates. Hope you can find some, but know you will come up with something just as cute! Hold on, Spring break is almost here! Then it will be down hill from there.
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;We did have a very nice time.  I really need a couple of days in Atlanta to get in all the shopping I want to do...Homegoods stores and The Container Store and Ballard Outlets.  I don&#039;t think those bunny plates are going to show up anywhere, but I did run across some cute ones at Pier One that I am thinking about.

		<description><![CDATA[We often do something similar for our kids&#039; birthdays.  It&#039;s fun to enjoy a day from their point of view, and it always stretches us to find/do new things.
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh yes, it certainly does stretch us to try out new things!  He kept asking for us to go to Disney for a day, and I had to just say no to driving that far for only one day. (I think he was just joking, but he is such a Disney-aholic that he might have been serious!)
