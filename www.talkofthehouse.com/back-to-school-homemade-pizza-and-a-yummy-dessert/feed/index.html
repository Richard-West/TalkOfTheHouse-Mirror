		<description><![CDATA[The table setting is adorable! I recreated it with my granddaughter, using her American Girl doll&#039;s school desk as the centerpiece. Around it we placed her class picture, an old dictionary, small calculator, stapler, and composition book, along with pencils, rulers etc and the &quot;chalkboard&quot; placemats. So much fun for our Labor Day lunch. Thank you Kelly for the creative inspiration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;How super smart!  I have been wondering where I could find a desk like that.  Thanks for the inspiration! I love American Girls dolls and all the accessories.  We had Bitty Baby things here (and I have saved all of them for future little ones here.)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing!
Enjoyed your celebration.
Tell me about the red plaid drapes (where to buy, name of fabric) and you do get good mileage using your red napkins. 
Where can I purchase them.  The red just makes what you write and show so enjoyable. I am a big fan of yours and the color RED!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Nan, click on &quot;The House&quot; part of the red menu bar at the top of the blog and then scroll to the dining room info.  You will find a link to the drapery fabric.  The red napkins came from a small local shop, but I would bet that Williams Sonoma and Pottery Barn would have similar with the holiday season coming soon.  We could start a fan club for lovers of red here!
