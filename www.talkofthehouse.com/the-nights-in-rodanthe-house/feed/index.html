		<description><![CDATA[Yes; I would build a beach home on oceanfront property on Hatteras Island, and design it to withstand the weather, just expensive for the I surance, right now I&#039;m working on it, retiring in couple year&#039;s, moving to OBX. The Inn At Rodanthe is breathtaking and I commend the owner&#039;s for all their hard work on saving the house. Project of this nature is very expensive but it&#039;s only folding money, a wise investment, but will recoup their investment in few year&#039;s, I&#039;d do the same except add a dumb waiter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have been coming to Rodanthe since 2006 and staying at True Grit on N Holiday, I have walked by your house so many times, my dream is to one day stay (just 1 night) in Serendipity.  I just finished watching the movie again (yes I cried)
This year we are going farther south since we have 11, You can bet the 1st week of August I will be walking by your house, and loving every minute. Thank you for buying and restoring and moving Serendipity!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;As much as I would like for Serendipity to be our house, I am afraid that it is not.  I am just a blogger who is writing about the restoration of it.  Hopefully the real owners will see your comment Connie, and I hope that you get to stay there on one of your next vacations. :)
