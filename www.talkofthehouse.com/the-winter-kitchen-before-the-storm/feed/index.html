		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

Have you ever written a blog post about Asheville, NC? We are planning a weekend get-a-way, and I thought to myself, I bet Kelly has been there!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Stacey, we have not been to Asheville in almost 30 years, so I am afraid I have not written a post about it.  The last time we were there was on an April Fool&#039;s Day when they had a freak winter storm dump 12 inches of snow, and we had a VERY difficult time getting back home.  We visited the Biltmore on our honeymoon decades ago, and I am sure there are many wonderful places to visit there.  Have fun on your trip!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
