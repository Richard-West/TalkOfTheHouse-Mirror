		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, you always make everything you do look effortless!!  Have you ever had a major &quot;fail&quot; when entertaining/decorating?  

What a lovely, lovely party for your father-in-law.  Embrace your precious parents.....mine are both gone now and I miss them tremendously.  

Thanks for sharing your home and your life with your many online friends. God bless you.

&lt;em&gt;I&#039;ve had birthday cakes that don&#039;t look worth a flip!  (But they taste fine.)  My biggest problem with entertaining is I am never finished with everything when it is time for guests to show up...no matter how far ahead I start.  (My husband was still outside putting out pinestraw when his parents arrived for the birthday party!)  I guess I just put too much on those to-do lists. :)
