		<description><![CDATA[This house is gorgeous but I do think I like the other one a smidge better. DiAnne who commented above is being very modest as she has a beautiful house on Lake Keowee that is filled with pretty antiques and cool art! She is also very, very sweet to invite her friends to enjoy it also!
I went in a house yesterday that I wish I had pictures to share. I took my granddaughter to a birthday party of a cute little girl in her preschool class who has the cutest mom. Well all last summer I strolled my grandson by the little girl&#039;s grandparents so cool 1930  huge rock house with a cute guest house. Last summer the guest house was added onto and redesigned on the outside and a wraparound porch was added. I thought that my granddaughter&#039;s preschool friend and her family had moved into the cool guest house. Come to find out the grandparents moved into the guest house and the young family bought the super cool huge rock house. Well you know me, I just had to walk all through the house and every room was the prettier than the room before. I told the cute mom that I was shocked the house had never been in a magazine. I just love it when a normal ole&#039; day turns into something fun like touring a house you have long admired.
Happy Thursday Kelly!]]></description>
