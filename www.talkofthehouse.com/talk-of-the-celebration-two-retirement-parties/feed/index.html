		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to your husband on his retirement. I have no doubt the two of you will be touring the country and even to other parts of the world. Enjoy the excitement. I agree with several others,   your planning and party decor themes should be compiled and published. So, I will await and continue to encourage you to put on a new hat: author. Of course, I will want a signed copy:)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Too funny Sandy!  If I was writing a book, I would be too busy to host parties. LOL  
I do hope we will be touring the country some soon.  I really want to go to see our son in Seattle.  I just wish our other two children had their spring breaks during the same week, but of course, they don&#039;t. :( 
Thank you for the congratulations for my husband.  I know he is going to enjoy retirement.
