		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry to hear about your father-in-law and your illness. Hope everything works out for the best!! :) Yeah, giving up chocolate would be pretty hard. ;)

&lt;em&gt;I think my father in law may actually get to come home from the hospital this week.  Giving up chocolate has so not been fun!  Especially in this season of hot cocoa. :(
