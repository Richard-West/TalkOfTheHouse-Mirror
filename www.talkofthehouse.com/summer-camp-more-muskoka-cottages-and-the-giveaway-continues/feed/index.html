		<description><![CDATA[I love your sight and I have just discovered you from Pnterest. I love Muskoka but cannot afford to live there. I do however live on the waters of Lake Simcoe. My husband and I have a small bungalow here with our boat in the water off out back door. I have also tried to decorate nautical throughout my home and sunroom and I do get a lot of compliments on the decorating and the landscaping. Love to spend my days looking at sites such as yours and look forward to many more articles from you. Keep up the great work!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am jealous of your having a lake house Susan!  That has been a dream of mine for a long time (brought on by On Golden Pond I&#039;m sure. LOL)  Thank you for your encouraging words here!  I appreciate them greatly. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly.  I just discovered your blog on Cindy Hattersley blog, Rough Luxe.  I live on a Lake in Southern California and just love reading about other lakes and the beautiful homes that populate them.  Keep the lake stuff comin!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh how lucky you are to live on a lake Celia!  I am glad to know that there are other people out there that share my love of lake houses. :)  Thank you so much for jumping over from Cindy&#039;s blog to visit here.  I will have to take a visit to yours (especially if you live on a lake!)
