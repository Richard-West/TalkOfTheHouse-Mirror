		<description><![CDATA[Kelly....going through your posts and saw this one and am curious....what house in Florida have you stayed that was in a movie...what movie?  Inquiring minds (mine) want to know!  
Andrea :)

thanks again for helping me find the HGTV dream home in Rose mary beach Fl

&lt;em&gt;Andrea, that house is Katie&#039;s Light in Fernandina - seen in the very last scene of the movie Pippi Longstocking.  I did a post on the cottage here: http://www.talkofthehouse.com/katies-light/ .  We have also seen the house from the movie The Truman Show in Seaside.  Unfortunately, it is not available for rent, but I think the house Jim Carey stayed in while filming the move is available for rent there (the Carey Cottage.)

		<description><![CDATA[I would love to visit Maine!  Just came across your blog and I&#039;m lovin&#039; all these destinations!......The reader who asked about P.E.I.  It is a beautiful place to visit...Stayed at the Charlotte&#039;s Rose Inn  in downtown Charlottetown (small and quaint).  Loved it! The Anne of Green Gables play is very well done.  If you visit Aiken House and Gardens blog you can learn more of this beautiful province in Canada.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Anita, welcome! I am so glad you found your way to the blog.  I would LOVE to be headed back to Maine right now!  (especially with the humidity here this bright sunny morning.)  Thanks for all the info on Prince Edward&#039;s Island.  I hope we get there one day.
Enjoy your weekend!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
