		<description><![CDATA[Your super bowl table is darling!  We had a big party with some of our kids, but I didn&#039;t decorate the table special like you did.  We had two of the same things you had.  Little smokies and a cheezy dip.  Also had stuffed jalapenos, crab nachos, cheese ball, and cinnamon bear popcorn for a sweet snack.  All was yummy!  Having a potato bar is a great idea.  May have to do that next year.  Happy to be following you.
hugs,
