		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Disney!  You are so lucky to have so many wonderful vacations with your family, especially as old as your kids are now.  I am giggling at the family picture in front of the train station...Of course you needed that picture!  Thanks Kelly for sharing your family fun with all your blog followers.

&lt;em&gt;Quit your giggling girl! :)  Everyone has their picture in front of the train station...no matter what their age, right?? :) (There was quite a bit of eye rolling from my kids with this one!)
