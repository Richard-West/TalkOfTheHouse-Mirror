		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve stayed at Blackberry twice years apart and loved it both times. Once in the house and once in a cottage. It has become the benchmark by which we rate all other inns. Have to say that none have come close. Attention to detail is astonishing. I did like it more when it was smaller and less popular. I guess I just wanted it all just for us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I haven&#039;t been there as a guest, but I worked there for one day (I mentioned that in another comment). I live in Knoxville and have had quite a few friends work there in the kitchen. One friend used to bring home leftovers....yummy. The grounds, rooms, everything is just as lovely as the pictures. My one day of working there consisted of a grand tour of everything. They have many celebrity guests who stay there for privacy, so I would imagine that&#039;s why they have the high end kitchens. I also know of some weathier people here who have rented homes up there while getting high end remodels (that would nice, huh?) You used to be able to drive right up to the farm, but they probably have a gate now. You wouldn&#039;t be able to just walk around on the grounds. I had to sign a confidentiality agreement before they would even take me on a tour of the property. The farmers up there come down and sell items at our farmer&#039;s market. For a little taste of some of the same but on a smaller scale, check out The Dancing Bear Lodge in Townsend. It used to be owned by Blackberry (I&#039;m not sure of the ownership now, but one owner used to be the GM at Blackberry). I&#039;m working on getting my husband to take me up there for an anniversary weekend. I keep trying to tell him that the money we would save on gas would make up for the $800 a night price tag (for the cheap room) LOL!

&lt;em&gt;Missy â€“ Thanks for all the Blackberry info! Saving money on gas is a good argument for your husband with the price to stay there. :)
