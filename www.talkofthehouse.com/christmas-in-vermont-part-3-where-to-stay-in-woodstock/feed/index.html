		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this Kelly ... I&#039;ve enjoyed it soooo much, travelling vicariously is such a fun thing to do, especially in all that snow! Although, maybe not the driving so much!! Glad you had such a wonderful time. I&#039;d love to visit Woodstock one Winter... or Summer. We didn&#039;t make it there when we visited Stowe... I&#039;m regretting that now! Looking forward to Part 4.
Have a great weekend Kelly ...

		<description><![CDATA[Omg Kelly I can&#039;t believe it took 3 hrs to get from Stowe to Woodstock. You must&#039;ve been on the edge ofyour seat! I&#039;ve seen rte. 89 like that many a time!  That&#039;s why we all have four wheel drive up here! Lol..So glad you got to experience yet another beautiful N E town. For the future when you return which I know you will, you must stop in Queechee and check out the beautiful gorge and antiques mall. Can&#039;t wait to see part three!]]></description>
