		<description><![CDATA[All of these are super cute ideas! How easy to incorporate into the classroom as well. Like the one from CatchMyParty.com Instead of the food, the teacher could put out some school supplies. (Found for cheap of course! Or maybe even donated from stores, churches.)There are always those parents who struggle buy even the basic supplies. I see labels for supplies and cabinets, bulletin board ideas, door decorations. Almost makes me wish I were back in the classroom. Almost! Thanks for the inspiration! Hope you have your best year yet!

&lt;em&gt;Great idea Jayne!  Thank you for the well wishes!

		<description><![CDATA[You are one busy lady - don&#039;t know how you keep the comings and goings straight.  Love the idea of a back to school party and so many cute ideas.  Your daughter&#039;s graduation party was amazing - wonderful attention to detail!!

&lt;em&gt;A calendar helps tremendously!  So glad you liked all the parties - including ours!
