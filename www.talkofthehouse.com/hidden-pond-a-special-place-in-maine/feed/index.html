		<description><![CDATA[Had to read the post on Kennebunkport as it drew my eye (being a down east New Englander) what a lovely place. Today is a ten here on the N.E.coast, the kind of day where they take lots of pictures that showcase fall&#039;s glory. Am enjoying scrolling through many of your posts, it is my first visit here, sent by the indomitable Rhoda. I loved viewing your home and all your seasonal decorating, just lovely. Hope to become a regular visitor, thanks!

&lt;em&gt;Hi Paula! Even though I would say it is also a 10 here today, I would LOVE to be in New England with this gorgeous weather. I bet it is gorgeous! I have a number of posts on Maine, so I hope you enjoy them. So glad you found your way over here from Rhoda’s! Thank you for taking the time to leave a sweet comment. I do hope you will come back again.
Enjoy your Sunday afternoon.

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I am like you and live here in Ga. and love New England and we just got back from a short trip there. Was disappointed that it was extremely foggy when we visited Martha&#039;s Vineyard. Visited Maine many years ago and would love to go back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Kim – Oh I am jealous…we didn’t get to go to Martha’s Vineyard on our trip. Maine was gorgeous when we were there. We too had fog but it did burn off to a pretty day most of the days we were there. I would love to go back too.
