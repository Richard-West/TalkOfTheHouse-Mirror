		<description><![CDATA[I just pinned all of those chalkboard ideas. Thank you! Louvina sounds just like my momma! She is saying that very same thing about the seasons. I am so enjoying this weather! I love the black and white thrown in with the red. I did that too this year...I bet you aren&#039;t surprised. I know you have enjoyed having your three children home! Blessings to you, Kelly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your blog brought me JOY, Kelly!  I have had a weary year.  We just relocated in November from PA to TX. I got the same pillow cover from Pottery Barn to remind me that &quot;All is calm, all is bright!&quot; I have opened so many boxes that I shudder at the idea of opening presents.  I have been blessed with so much that I need NOTHING. We simplified Christmas in our new home by just decorating with fresh greens and bowls of oranges and pomegranates...with pops of our favorite red everywhere! I have needed the REST from the moving chaos and usual Christmas overload, so we have balanced hours of putting a home back together with walks through new neighborhoods in the twilight to enjoy the lights (and everyone else&#039;s hard work). Judging by the tone and text of her note, I believe I am currently flying to my sister&#039;s, &quot;Wendy in KY,&quot; to celebrate Christmas Day with family.  Your blog is my escape on long flights and I always enjoy the peace and sense of balance in everything you do.  Thank you for that! Have a blessed day and a wonderful New Year!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Dawn, I am sorry to hear that 2015 made you weary , but I am glad that the blog brought you joy.  Moving really zaps anyone of energy because it involves a ton of labor, and it is mentally draining to have to start over in some place new.  I hope the remainder of your Christmas provided some rest for you.  It sounds like your neighborhood walks are wonderful!  I hope your 2016 brings renewed strength and many fun times in your new home.
Happy 2016!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
