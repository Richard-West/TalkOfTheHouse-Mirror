		<description><![CDATA[I love your house - it is charming.  If we ever put new siding on our house I want to do something vertical. Currently it has the old  fifties shingle siding.  Would you be willing to share your house paint color?

&lt;em&gt;Hi Teresa!
Sure I&#039;ll be glad to share the paint color.:)  It is a Martin Senour paint called Pelham Gray...although it is not really a gray like you think of gray...it has more green in it which makes it look khaki.  We have to repaint our exterior this fall, and for the first time I think we will stick with what we&#039;ve had.  We have really liked the color.  Good luck with your house exterior, and thank you for your sweet compliment on ours!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
