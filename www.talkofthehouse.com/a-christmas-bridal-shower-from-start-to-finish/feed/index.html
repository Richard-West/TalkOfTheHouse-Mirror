		<description><![CDATA[Such a beautiful Bridal Shower.  Can I ask how you learned Calligraphy?  Did you teach yourself, or did you take classes for it?  Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Kaye Ann.  I taught myself lettering by just playing around with a pen and practicing.  While my mother paints as her art, lettering is mine.  (I can&#039;t paint worth a flip!)

		<description><![CDATA[How special to be able to host the bridal shower for your daughter&#039;s friend. I always love seeing your party details. I bet they had the best time at their &quot;sleepover!&quot; :) Smart decision to keep the menu simple this time of year. Those peppermint bark cookies look delicious! I will definitely try the recipe. I love your milk glass. My family has some also and we used milk glass, including a few family pieces for my daughter&#039;s shower a few years ago. :)]]></description>
