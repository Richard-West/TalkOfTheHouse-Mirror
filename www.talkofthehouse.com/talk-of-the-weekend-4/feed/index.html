		<description><![CDATA[I got to meet Jan Karon when she came to Birmingham. It was wonderful!  She is so genuine and warm- and will shake everyones hand and is not camera shy. A real Southern gem!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;OMG how lucky you were Vicki!!  So jealous here.  I know you enjoyed that evening, and I do wish I could have been there too.  Hopefully there will be another book tour in the future (when I am retired!)

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday and Happy Anniversary!!! Boy, August is just full of celebration for y&#039;all! January is like that for us. 
You did cover a lot in this post! I loved to see your family in the pictures. I hope your school year is going well for you so far. You have such sweet teacher friends. They are the best, aren&#039;t they? Hope the roller coaster slows down soon for you. Enjoy the ride!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Jayne!  I don&#039;t know if I could take a January like our August.  That would be right on the heels of the Christmas holidays...quite exhausting!  Yes, my teacher friends are great. :)
