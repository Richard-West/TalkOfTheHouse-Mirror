		<description><![CDATA[Adopt me, please. So I can have the best birthday celebrations, ever! The entire house was so simply and beautifully adorned - just the right for an &quot;adult&quot; Disney partay! I love petit-fours, too, but how did you ever get the M and M&#039;s to actually stick in that firm icing? (That was the cutest touch and so economical.) You really need to do a party book: food, decorations, gift ideas, etc. You have the best touch with all you do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know you just retired from teaching school but event planning might be your next calling!;) I always love your parties, attention to detail but never over the top and you can do a theme like no other. I hope Hayley had a happy birthday and I&#039;m sure she was thrilled with her Disney party! Great job, Mom:)]]></description>
