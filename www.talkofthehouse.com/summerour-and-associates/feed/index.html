		<description><![CDATA[You speak to my heart. We used to stop at the New Perry Inn to spend the night when on our way from Kentucky to Florida. Such happy memories! And our favorite place in the world is St Simons Island. We are trying to decide if we can leave our three grandchildren to move there. I love everything you post! Thanks so much!!]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;Hi Martha!  So sorry your computer crashed, but I am glad you were able to bring it back to life. :) Yes, Summerour and Associates ARE amazing.  I know exactly what you mean about ripping out half your house and spending the big bucks.
