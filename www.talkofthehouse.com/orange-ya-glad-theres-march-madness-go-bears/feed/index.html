		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having to catch up on posts!! Since I live about a mile from Neyland Stadium, I guess I better throw a &quot;Go Vols&quot; into the ring, even though I&#039;m a little late for the party ;-) I do have to admit (I can do that here because you guys will understand), I&#039;m not a fan of orange. I&#039;m probably the only person in this whole town without an orange sweatshirt. LOL!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Congratulations to Mercer!  
Orange doesn&#039;t normally figure into my &quot;favorite colors for design&quot; wheelhouse, but these rooms are truly fresh and orange clearly adds to the overall design.  Pretty images.
Great post.
xo,
Karen

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Karen.  Orange isn&#039;t among my favorites in design either, but you are right.  Fresh is the correct word for the look of it in a room. Glad you enjoyed the post.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
