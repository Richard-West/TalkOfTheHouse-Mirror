		<description><![CDATA[That was fun!I enjoy shopping in unique places. I clicked on every store link. I am putting this on the list of places to go when Josie retires..in eight days!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;8 days wow! I know she is excited. My husband thinks he has 11 more to go unless they offer him some major incentive to stay.  Glad you enjoyed the virtual shopping. :)
