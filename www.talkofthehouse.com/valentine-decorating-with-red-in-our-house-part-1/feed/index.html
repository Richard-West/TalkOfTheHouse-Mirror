		<description><![CDATA[I have really enjoyed all of your Valentine&#039;s Day posts with all of the touches of RED!!  Love every room in your house!  Where did you find all of your little red flower pots and the red fabric for your bathroom drapes?  You have really inspired to think out of the box and use more red in my dÃ©cor!!
Great job!
Jenny

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Jenny.  I am glad you enjoyed all the posts.  The red pot in the master bedroom was one from Christmas that had an amaryllis in it (from Target.)  The other one in the post came from Walmart.  The bathroom drapes are old ones from several years ago from Target.
You go right ahead and put all the red you can in your decor. :)
