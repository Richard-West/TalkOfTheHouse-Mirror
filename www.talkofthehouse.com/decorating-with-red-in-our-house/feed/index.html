		<description><![CDATA[I have just discovered your site via Hooked on Houses. Your house is lovely and inspiring. Feels warm and friendly. I particularly like your khaki sofa and as I am about to order new sofas for our front (not so great!) room, am thinking this color is a good option as it appears to go with different color schemes but stays looking neutral too.
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh Voula, I am so glad Julia&#039;s site led you to Talk of the House!  I am very appreciative of Julia sharing the blog love for my little blog here.  She is terrific! Your choice of a khaki sofa is a smart one I think.  It works so well with any color scheme and can be updated with simple throw pillows any time you get the urge to change your dÃ©cor.  I have been trying to talk my mother into getting one too!
Please stop in to visit here again. :)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Love the red!  Just found your blog and love it. I live in Atlanta  and love the southern areas you feature.  I love your framed black and white photos in those frames. I have checked michaels and they don&#039; carry them.  Could you give more info on them.  Maybe I can find on line. Thanks and keep up the good work.]]></description>
