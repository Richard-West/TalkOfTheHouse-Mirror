		<description><![CDATA[Totally addicted to your posts! You have so many great ideas. Can&#039;t wait to see what you do for Valentines. It&#039;s always a tricky event here since it is also our son&#039;s birthday. Looking forward to your next post!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Wow!  Thank you Amanda!  That would be tricky to have a boy&#039;s birthday along with Valentine&#039;s Day.  My husband&#039;s birthday is the day after it, so at least it is not on the actual day.  Good luck with your planning!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
As usual you&#039;ve knocked it out of the park!  I was rooting for the Falcons but alas, the other team won.  The Patriots played a great second half.  The highlight for me, besides the commercials, was the catch by the Falcon that seemed impossibly and so impressive.
I cannot believe how much Gabbie has grown.  
xo,
Karen
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you so much Karen.  Glad you were rooting for the Falcons too!  I was very impressed with that catch as well.  Amazing what those athletes can do!
Yes, Gabbie is growing right before our eyes.  She has gotten almost too heavy for me to pick up!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
