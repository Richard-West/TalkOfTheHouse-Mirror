		<description><![CDATA[How fun was this post!!!  And, reading everyone&#039;s comments was too!  I am glad to know that I am not the only &quot;dish hoarder&quot; out here!  Your Thanksgiving post last year inspired me so much that I think I emailed photos to you, didn&#039;t I?  I have eight antique blue and white turkey plates called Country Fair by L&#038;M.  I am in love with them!  LOL!  (A great aunt actually gifted them to my sister and I begged her to sell them to me. She did and I still feel a wee bit guilty.) We usually have more than eight people for Thanksgiving so I mix the turkey plates with the blue and white Lochs of Scotland dishes that Amber mentioned above.... which brings up the same conversation every Thanksgiving.  While growing up, at our house everyone had a different dinner plate. My mom was so &quot;outside the box/before her time&quot; but I didn&#039;t realize how special that was then. (My plate was from a restaurant in California called The Doll House.) When I was around eight years old I told my grandmother that when I grew up all my dishes were going to match. So, for Christmas my mother received a set of matching dishes which we used briefly before going back to using our &quot;special&quot; plates.  I do just love dishes!  I have Holiday by Lenox Christmas china that I leave in my glass china cabinet year round and I have gingerbread everyday Christmas dishes made by Hartstone.  You might like them because the rim of the plates is red checkered. Oops, those don&#039;t actually totally match but they coordinate like the turkey dishes with the Lochs of Scotland.  I am not telling you my other dishes because I AM sounding like a dish hoarder.  Thanks for another fun, memory-evoking post!

&lt;em&gt;What a wonderful story about all the Thanksgiving dishes Kathy!  Love it!  And I think you are in good company here with all of us dish hoarders (and you should see my mother&#039;s attic!!)

		<description><![CDATA[I love all of these special holiday dishes.  I never thought of just getting special salad plates to get the look without a big investment.  

Personally, I&#039;ve wanted a set of Christmas dishes for a long time.  My mother has one &#038; uses it as her everyday dishes from just after Thanksgiving until New Years.  It&#039;s such a nice way to make the holidays part of everyday life.]]></description>
