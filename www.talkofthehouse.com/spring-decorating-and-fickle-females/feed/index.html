		<description><![CDATA[No.no.no.......please do not change your home!  I love the pretty colors and all that you do to make your home wonderful and cozy!  white is nice, but after awhile it is boring and blah.
Again my thanks for your lovely posts!
Blessings,

&lt;em&gt;LOL Don&#039;t worry, we are sure not going all white here.  It would never work with a husband that comes in dirty from yard work...and the dog...and just life in general here. :) I would like the look in our summer heat, but it would seem rather cold to me in winter...so no worries.  All the color is staying. :)

		<description><![CDATA[After leaving my question about your paint color, I saw you had posted the color as Brandon beige took a look at the sample and feared it might be to dark so went for Bleeker beigh. Hope I will get the same look you have. Is that something you would recommend?  What a pleasing look you have.

&lt;em&gt;Hi Sandra!
I have heard that you can ask paint stores to &quot;lighten&quot; a paint for you, but I have never done that.  I looked up some rooms done in Bleeker Beige (having never used it before) and it does look similar but lighter.  So I think that will give you a similar look.  Hope it works for you!
