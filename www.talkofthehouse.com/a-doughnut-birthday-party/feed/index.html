		<description><![CDATA[Er...  I hate to tell you this, but it is quite commonplace to see Krispy Kreme doughnuts for sale at our local yard sales.  Seems it is a great way for the homeowner&#039;s child to glean sales.  Of course, who can walk by an innocent child, with an endearing look on their face, just begging you to buy a KK? Not me, I tell you!  Loved your party ideas, and thanks for sharing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are always amazing!  Details, details.
You and your Mother are blessed!
As always, like the reds.
Give us details on the fondue pot, please.
Electric,, yet.  Woo, Woo
Tell us what you are serving in it?    What kind, type of chocolate?  Brand of pot?  
Could it work for a small group  like 4-6?
Thanks!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Nan!  The electric fondue pot is made by Cuisinart, and I believe my husband got it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond (with a 20% off coupon!) The chocolate for that party was simply 2 bags of melting chocolates..Ghirardelli I think...one bag milk chocolate and one bag dark.  It certainly would work for a small party!  Such fun!
