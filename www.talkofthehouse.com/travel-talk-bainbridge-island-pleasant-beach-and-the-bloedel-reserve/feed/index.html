		<description><![CDATA[Kelly!! The company my husband works for built the newest Lynnwood Center/Pleasant Beach Village! Isn&#039;t it beautiful? AND, you drove right by our home to get to the Blodel Reserve!!!! We live on Dolphin Drive. Our boys used to Trick-or-Treat at the Reserve. So creepy driving past the pond to the mansion. I drive by the Grand Forest often but have not ever hiked it. Thanks for sharing my home area with your readers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That is amazing Barbara!  Yes, Pleasant Beach Village was WONDERFUL!  I loved that area, and they did a fabulous job with it. I can&#039;t believe we went right past your house!  What a small small world.  Trick or treating at Bloedel would have been great, but I agree that the pond would have been quite spooky.
Thank you for reading and commenting.  Glad to share your beautiful area of our country.

		<description><![CDATA[What a peaceful tranquil garden to meander through. :) And the view from the home is just gorgeous!! Looks like you had some beautiful weather!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, it was.  I cannot begin to imagine how much work went into making a garden like that. It was simply gorgeous, and we are lucky that the family decided to open it up for the public to enjoy.  The weather was good that day.  Sunny days were a real blessing on that trip!
