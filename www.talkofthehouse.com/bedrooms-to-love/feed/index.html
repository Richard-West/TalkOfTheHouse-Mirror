		<description><![CDATA[Such beautiful bedrooms!  My master bedroom has just been sitting unfinished for so long.  Why is it that we leave that one for so long while we do everything else??  I&#039;m inspired by these to get busy on it.  Thanks, Kelly!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Lindsay ‚Äì I think we leave our master bedrooms for last because we are the only ones who go in them. We really ought to do them first so that we have a pampering place to retreat to at the end of a day (but I totally understand wanting the ‚Äúvisited‚Äù rooms to look their best.) Glad you were inspired by these, and good luck with getting yours done!
