		<description><![CDATA[Such beautiful photos of what I imagine Mitford and surrounding area looks like. Thank you for sharing them. They make me long to visit with Father Tim and Cynthia again.
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;So glad you enjoyed them, Gaye.  Hang on until September.  Then we can visit with Father Tim in the new book!

		<description><![CDATA[Long before Jan Karon&#039;s grand, brave adventure into the Mitford books began, I was blessed to visit the Mast General Store, in the tow of some dear friends from the Charlotte area.  They owned a lovely cabin in the hills of Blowing Rock at the time, and we&#039;d traveled across country to have a visit.  If I could live anywhere else in the world, it would be Blowing Rock, NC.  My momma was born in Kansas (to me, the near South); my dad and me are native Oregonians...but I do believe I lean toward the southern side of the family.  Why, you may ask?  Because the dearest side dish I could eat is grits. :-)   

Thank you so much for the lovely visit, and the sweet reminder of some of my favorite memories. :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Your trip sounds wonderful, and I would love to live in Blowing Rock, too. Isn&#039;t it just the most precious town?! Oh I love grits as well! :)  Cook them with whipping cream, and add some butter...yum! I am glad you enjoyed the post.  It was a fun one to write.
