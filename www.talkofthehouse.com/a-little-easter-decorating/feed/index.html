		<description><![CDATA[Loving the basket for your daughter, what a thoughtful mom you are. I just know she enjoyed everything in there and I hope it took away a little of her homesickness. I am just catching up with all your posts as I am (finally) feeling like myself three weeks post the knee replacement surgery. I think it was a good time of year to go in - dreary end of March, and to recuperate - as spring blossoms forth in April. At least we are hoping for that in New England! I am going to have to take you to task for the red candles, I just know you could put a more charming spin on that, say, a Kelly green candle color! You don&#039;t have to go the pastel route, a vibrant spring color would be fine. (Think all the wonderful things in your garden.)Hope spring break was productive as well as fun and relaxing to some degree. You will be in the home stretch now for the school year so I am sure that brings its own challenges. Enjoy! Enjoy!

&lt;em&gt;I think the basket and trip worked wonders for our daughter. Thank you for catching up on all the posts.  I hope you&#039;re well on the way to recovery.  Candles...a problem.  You see I only like those larger ones in our candlesticks here, and my source has stopped selling them. :(  So all I have at my disposal are red and white.  What I would have LOVED would have been some yellow ones.  I am always keeping my eye out for them.  And when I find them, I will definitely buy them in some assorted other colors. :)  Spring break was productive, and I am looking forward to finishing out this last school year.  Summer is 32 school days away. :)
