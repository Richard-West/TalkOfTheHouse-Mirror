		<description><![CDATA[I so enjoyed your post!  I love your great list of the joys of Summer and the beautiful pictures of your rooms.  You&#039;re right, it makes such a difference just by the direction from which the sun is shining.  I would enjoy having your blog put into book form.  What a great coffee table book it would make!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your website, love your house! I&#039;m wondering what paint color you used in your master bedroom? I love it - I love decorating with reds and blues and that wall color is perfect!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Hi Angela! So glad you like the house!  Yes, that neutral color works great with red and blue.  The color is pretty much the same throughout the entire house.  I believe that room is Twine, an old Martha Stewart from K-mart color, but I have had it color matched to Lyndhurst Timber from Valspar at Lowes.  Benjamin Moore makes a very similar one that is a little bit lighter - Brandon Beige.  That is what we have in the family room.
Hope this helps!
