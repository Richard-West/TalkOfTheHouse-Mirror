&lt;em&gt;No problem.  He has had a rough time with his health this year, hasn&#039;t he?!  Glad to know he was out and about.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
    I continue to read your blog and hoping your enjoying your retirement.  I just wanted to tell you that I was at Ogunquit, MA Aug 31 through Sept 3. I was wondering if it could be possible you were there at the same time? My husband and I stayed at the Beachmere Inn which is facing the ocean and on Marginal Way. It was my second time at the Beachmere.  The original building is an old Victorian home which was first built in the 1800&#039;s.  The house had 7 bedrooms originally and now must have about 30 or 40. It is amazing that they were able to break the home up the way they have.  It still has the lovely Victorian charm! We stayed in the original Victorian. They added two additional buildings since the 1960&#039;s and did a wonderful job blending everything in as well. I have only stayed in the original Victorian house and love it. We hope to go back again next year. I believe there has only been 2 or 3 possible families that have owned this place. We also had the pleasure of seeing George W. Bush arrive to eat at Barnacle Billys! He was amazing, with all his health issues he was just beaming with smiles as people realized it was the former president who was arriving at Perkins Cove and of course the picture taking began. Since we were sitting in a trolley about to take off in minutes we were unable to take a picture.  Regards, Noreen Maine (yes! my last name is spelled like the state!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Noreen, we were there in mid-August...like the 16th I think.  (It is taking me awhile to get all the posts from the trip out!)  Isn&#039;t that area of Maine just wonderful?!!  The Beachmere looks like a great place to stay.  After looking at their site, I would want to stay in the original Victorian too.  I hope when we return to Maine we will stay in Perkins Cove.  We traveled all the way up to Bar Harbor on this trip and stayed in Camden as our &quot;home base,&quot; but I really do love the Ogunquit area the best.  On our previous trip we stayed in Kennebunkport, and I loved that little town too.  And how exciting to see the former president at Barnacle Billy&#039;s!  Wow!  You were in the right place at the right time. :)
