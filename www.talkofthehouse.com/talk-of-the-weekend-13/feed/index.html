Must stay well in this beginning of the new year!! Got back from the beach, dug in and have most of the Christmas decorations down and storing them back in the attic storage area. Cold weather coming down the pike!! Brr-- will make it feel just like Christmas for your BHG article!! Made a huge pot of beef barley vegetable soup and my late made fruit cake is now seasoned and ready-- really turned out good for my first try! Hope to hear about everything you&#039;re doing soon!!
