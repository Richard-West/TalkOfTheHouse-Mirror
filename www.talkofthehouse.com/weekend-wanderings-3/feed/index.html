		<description><![CDATA[I love all your posts and I love pretty much all your ideas. We went to see Hope Springs last weekend. It was good, but I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. There are funny parts but it&#039;s more of a drama than comedy. It was good, parts were sad, parts were happy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thanks for your info on the movie Lynne! We still haven’t made it to the theater to see it but hopefully will do so soon. I wasn’t sure that it was much of a comedy – even though Steve Carell (who is often hilarious) is in it, but then he was in Crazy, Stupid, Love and even though it was funny – it was more of a drama to me (others will say it is a comedy.) Boy that was a long sentence! Anyway, thanks for taking the time to stop by and let me know your thoughts on it.
I hope you have a great weekend!

		<description><![CDATA[These look great! That rustic boathouse is fantastic. I will be happy to share my thermoses with you if you ever get very thirsty for plaid! Thanks for sharing the pics!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Pam – Thank you for the photos of your party. I have been in such a “lake state of mind” that I really wanted to share them this week. And thank you for the offer to use your collection of thermoses. I am definitely going to keep that in mind in future entertaining events!
