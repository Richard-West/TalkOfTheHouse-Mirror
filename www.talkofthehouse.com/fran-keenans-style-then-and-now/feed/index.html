		<description><![CDATA[I am almost certain there WAS a photo of the master bedroom in the original Cottage Living article (and obviously I really loved that house, too, if I can remember that).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thanks Angela! I just went back to my tear sheets and found it. You were right! I will add it to the post. It is amazing how many people remember that article. That should say something to Fran about the appeal of her work!

		<description><![CDATA[Oh how is miss Cottage Living. So many people blog about missing it, how were they not selling enough copies?? Fran&#039;s style reminds me a lot of Heather Chadduck&#039;s.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Missy – I don’t know how in the world they weren’t selling enough copies. I had a subscription, and I thought everyone else did too! Her style is very similar to Heather Chadduck’s, but it seems that Heather has gotten a lot more publicity than Fran has. I have seen more of Fran’s lately though. Perhaps having 3 little children slowed her down for awhile. I can certainly understand that!
