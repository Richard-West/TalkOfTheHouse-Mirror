		<description><![CDATA[I always wanted to go here and now I have:)  You really detail all the places you go so beautifully.   It feels like a mini vacation for me and I so appreciate it.  I don&#039;t know how you showed such restraint:) ha!  If you like the balsam sachets, Susan Branch sells a balsam draft stopper on her website I have 2 and I just love them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Too funny Charissa!  You are an arm chair traveler. :)  Thanks for the info on the balsam draft stopper.  If it smells like the LL Bean sachet, I know it must be fantastic!

&lt;em&gt;If you shop in the catalog, you will absolutely LOVE the store(s) Emily!  They are the catalogs come to life! :)  You need to make plans for that trip to Freeport (and other charming towns in Maine.)
