		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

I really love your fall decor...you did a great job of blending the reds and oranges.  I get so much inspiration from your blog.  I also had been toying with the idea of clearing the &quot;stuff&quot; off the tops of my kitchen cabinets.  After reading your blog, I took it all down ...baskets, plastic plants(ugh) ) and left it clean and simple.  It really opened my kitchen up and showcased some exposed brick. 

Thank you for your wonderful blog, ideas and inspiration!

Barb

&lt;em&gt;I&#039;m so glad you found some inspiration here Barbara. :)  Hooray for the clean space above the kitchen cabinets!  I can&#039;t believe you had exposed brick up there that was covered up.  I know that looks good now!
Thank YOU for reading and commenting.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree 100% there are seasonal foods and fall foods are my favorites! Everything you listed I associate with the season. And I try to indulge in as many as possible each year. ;) This week alone I have had apple cider donuts, apple butter, cooked apples and cider. I plan to bake a pumpkin cake this weekend. Haha, maybe I have overindulged. ;) My pumpkin cake recipe is very similar but uses self rising flour so no need for soda. I think my favorites are apple cake, apple crisp and cushaw pie that we have every year at Thanksgiving. Couldn&#039;t just pick one. :) As always I love all your decorative touches. The pumpkin dishes are perfect!  Love all your attention to detail. Now, I feel inspired to go add a few more touches and pops of color around my house!! :)

&lt;em&gt;You have had some yummy treats this week Gina!  Save me a slice of your pumpkin cake. LOL
Enjoy adding those pops of color to your home.  It is QUITE colorful here these days!
