		<description><![CDATA[Wow!  I miss the south this time of year.  It was a cold spring here in Nebraska and it is just starting to warm up.  Love the new lamps.  I really am liking Tarjay&#039;s lamps lately.  I have my eye on the floor lamp weathered wood finish.  
I usually try to bring in the Forsythia branches and yellow, blue, or green pillows for my white slipcovered furniture.  When the garden starts blooming I try to keep fresh flowers in the house.  
Hello Spring!]]></description>
