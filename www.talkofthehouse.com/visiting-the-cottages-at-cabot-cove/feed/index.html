		<description><![CDATA[Kelly... Not sure if you have read any books by Mary Kay Andrews... They are all great. She has a precious cottage on Tybee Island that you would love! Check it out.... www.breezeinncottage.com. Let&#039;s go there one day!!!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, I have read a couple of hers Kathy (actually read them sitting by the pool in St. Simons Island.) They are always good and make me laugh out loud! I’ve not read her latest – Spring Fever, though. Her cottage is to die for…it looks like the quintessential beach cottage – more “beachy” than nautical – which would make it very relaxing to me. I’d be more than happy to stay there!
