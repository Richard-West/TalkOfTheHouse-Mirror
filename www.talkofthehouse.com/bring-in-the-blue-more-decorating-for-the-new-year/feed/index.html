		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little slow packing the last of the Christmas away (I always hate to see it go), but today I&#039;m finally pulling out my blue books and accents. All of the beautiful snow is melting due to the warmer temps (welcome) and rain (not welcome) so I need to do something to lift my dreary mood. :)
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It is quite a dreary (and windy) day here too Lori.  Yay to bringing out the blue!  We will be putting away the last of the Christmas here, so maybe I can do some organizing in the attic since I bought some Christmas storage tubs at Walmart a week or so ago.  Have fun decorating!
