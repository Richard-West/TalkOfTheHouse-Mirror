		<description><![CDATA[Here in Florida it seems that all of the old homes buildings the old tourist road side places have been redone or so old and un cared for there&#039;s little left of them. Even the old gas stations and road side hotels from the 20&#039; and 30&#039;s are all but gone and forgotten. I have been looking for pictures and have taken pictures of as many of these old places that I can, which doesn&#039;t amount to very many. I try and plan on making paintings (pastel is my medium) of these forgotten places and try to show that they were once a homes, business places where families shared joy, lived life, shared hearbreak and lost love ones. Everything is new, sterile, cookie cutter and boring the fun is gone from old Florida and I miss it. Even the old Florida southern drawl has all but disappeared. Hope Mary Kaye Andrews keeps on writing and keeps the south from dying. Thanks, Valerie Wharton Tampa Florida]]></description>
