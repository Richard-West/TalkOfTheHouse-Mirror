 I love all your Spring green and yellow. It makes everything look fresh. Gabbie looks adorable with her little bow as well. I love daffodils this time of year but Gerbera Daises are my favorite flowers. Thanks for sharing! Take care.

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Kelly!  Daffodils and Spring green and yellow (and Gabi, too!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2665.png" alt="♥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) just brought smiles to me as I read through your blog post. Yes, it has been very mild here in central Virginia - more than mild, it was 78 on two days last week! Up and down... forsythia is blooming all over, tulip magnolias also. Daffodils, crocus...and it&#039;s only February!  I see neighbors planting, but I just have my forsythia wreath on the door, nothing more for the moment until I see if it snows once more.  I was caught in the April Fool&#039;s blizzard in Boston one year ha-ha!
Thank you for sharing all your idea with us.  You have a beautiful touch and sense of style and color. Happy Spring and pray it stays!  mari]]></description>
