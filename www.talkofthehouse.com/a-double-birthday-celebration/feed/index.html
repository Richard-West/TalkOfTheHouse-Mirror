		<description><![CDATA[Your husband&#039;s office is incredible and if it were mine, I would become a workaholic! The party looks great. I love how all of the lettering was done so with the classic Disney font! Now I want to go to make a quick trip to Disney Land!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Too funny!  Thank you for your sweet compliments Hailey.  I need to practice that font some more so that it can look more authentic.  Definitely make that trip to Disney Land! :)

		<description><![CDATA[We had State Testing this week (HUGE UGH!) so I am a little late getting around to reading. As always, loved your post. This is what I imagine: Family and/or friends hear that the party is at Kelly&#039;s house and everyone is instantly happy!  Who wouldn&#039;t be happy to get an invitation to a party at your house? ---  The hostess that plans down to the smallest details.....Which makes it all just spectacular! One more thing--Right before Christmas,  about 10 years ago I came home from school and my Hubs had the dining room table set in new red dishes.  (Believe me, this is SO NOT my husband.) Anyway, he had bought me a 100 piece set of solid red dishes. I mean that set has everything! ha! Anyway, instead of just leaving them under the tree for me to open, he had come home from work early and set the table using as much of it as he could. He had two of our sons help, and they even did cloth napkins, centerpieces and party favors (which told me he DOES pay attention to things i do!) Anyway, the whole point of that, is that I have used those red dishes in so many different ways, combined them with so many other dishes and just loved them. (How does a person live without red??!!) Thanks for another great post. Lori Lucas

&lt;em&gt;We&#039;ve had state testing for the last 2 weeks, and you are so right.  It is certainly a big ugh!  The poor children.  I think we are testing them to death. :( Your husband was a super sweetheart to not only buy you the red dishes, but to set it all up for you.  WOW! And it sounds like he spared no detail in getting it ready to surprise you.  How sweet!!  Yes, those red dishes are perfect for most every celebration.  Great minds think alike!
