		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I love those green plates from Dollar Tree!    I might just have to get some of those if I can find them.  Such a nice color for spring.
Your table settings are beautiful.
We celebrated Josie&#039;s birthday this weekend and the green doughnuts from Krispie Kreme were really good!  Thanks to Fred for waiting in the long line to get them.  Life is too short not to have a green doughnut--at least once.  
Have a good week.
DiAnne

&lt;em&gt;I am thinking about a whole different color combination using those green plates for Easter, so they are going to be quite versatile I think. :)  You should make a run to Dollar Tree!
I seriously contemplated those doughnuts but decided to forego the calories.  I KNOW they were delicious!  Fred is a keeper for sure. :)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
