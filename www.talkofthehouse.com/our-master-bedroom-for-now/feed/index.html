		<description><![CDATA[Love all the mix and match of plaids, etc., in your master.  You are so much braver than I!  It looks perfect.  I like the empty space on the wall near your chair.  If you decide to put anything there, you might want to consider red (I call it &quot;rose&quot;, but I don&#039;t think anyone else does!) transferware.  Maybe just 3 plates in a column.  Just a thought....hard to imagine.  

(OOPS....I just read the last comment from Michelle....nevermind!?!? lol)

&lt;em&gt;Susan – That is funny that you said I am brave. I love Sarah Richardson’s work, but I always think I am not brave enough to mix the patterns like she does so beautifully. I think I am just going to leave that wall space blank. There is enough on the walls with the pictures and the drapery fabric to keep the eyes busy. Plates would have been a good suggestion though if I were to put something up there. My mother in law has a ton of the “red” transferware (Old English Castles, maybe?), but I probably would opt for blue if I ever do it.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
Your bedroom is lovely...wish I lived closer so I could take that tallboy off your hands!  =)  You already had a great sense of style to be buying that at 17.  OK, this might sound a little too old fashioned, but I&#039;ve been into hanging china plates lately in areas that still need a little something.  But I&#039;m a dish fiend and always take a pretty pattern home when I see one.  Thanks for sharing your warm and cozy bedroom...
Michelle

&lt;em&gt;Michelle- I wish you lived closer too! I don’t know about the “sense of style” at 17, but I sure did love houses and rooms even at that age. As far as the plates go, I DID have a grouping of blue transferware plates hanging there at some point in time. Just decided that I wanted something different so I took them down…but they definitely fit the area. Good suggestion though!
