		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry the shops were closed. MANY things in my home are from Beyond the a Door and The French Market. Come back this summer any day but Sunday or Monday and they&#039;ll be open. Make sure to drive up to Tyrone (about 20 min north) and go to Circa Antiques and Déjà Vu consignment store. You won&#039;t regret it! I would also recommend coming on a day when Scott&#039;s in open. WIN WIN!]]></description>
