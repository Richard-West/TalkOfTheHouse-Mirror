		<description><![CDATA[I think I like the decor in his 1st house better, but if he could part with that coffee table in the second house, I would gladly take it off his hands!  ;-)  I too don&#039;t want to do wallpaper again,even though I used to sell it! Too much work, and hubs won&#039;t have it in our new house anyway, so I can always blame him!  ;-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I did too, Marianne.  It had more of the colors that I love.  Too funny about you and the coffee table. :)
I so agree with you about all the work with wallpaper (but you can go right ahead and blame your husband.)

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Kelly, Hello July! I agree on the Nantucket style/dÃ©cor. If money was no object those would be some key words in my directions to a decorator. (Too funny, I was going to mention that the living room was the cover of a book I have... it comes out in the spring as a coffee table accent. The pictures are so inspiring.)If I could choose anywhere to spend the summer months, well, Martha&#039;s Vineyard, a few Cape locales, and Hilton Head, would be on my list. You know why I think I am attracted to this decorating style - it&#039;s the fresh take on mixing the old family heirlooms or favorite pieces with other items one has accumulated. Gives a room a stylish yet comfy feel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I think you nailed it with the &quot;stylish yet comfy feel&quot; description Paula.  That is exactly what it is, and achieving it by using some family pieces in it is an accomplishment and a half!  That&#039;s too funny about your coffee table book. :)
