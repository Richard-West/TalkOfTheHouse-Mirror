		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I am so sorry you are still sick.  You are definitely in my thoughts and prayers.  It took a good six weeks for me, so do not worry about your fans, just take care of yourself. All your Halloween and fall decorating is beautiful.  I remember those Pottery Barn finds last year and I was so jealous I could not find them. Your husband is such a dear.  I do have one question: where do you store all your seasonal decorations?  Do you have a special closet or storage building? Sending love and gratitude your way!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you, Pat.  We have an attic space over the boys&#039; room that has shelves filled with tubs full of all of the seasonal things.  The pumpkin bowls had been stored in the cabinet above the refrigerator, but I think I am going to move them up to the attic, too.  I do keep the Christmas dishes in the cabinet in the dining room (but there is no logic as to why I do that!)  The foyer closet has built in shelves for all the throw pillows and drapes that get changed out around here.  I really do have to think about a logical way to keep things organized around here.  Otherwise I won&#039;t remember where in the world I have put stuff!
Have a good week.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
