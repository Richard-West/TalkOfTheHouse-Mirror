&lt;em&gt;Theresa – You need to make a trip there if you have never been. I had not been to the Beaufort area at all before, but I did visit Charleston when I was a teenager. We need to take a trip there soon. Glad you liked the pictures of Beaufort!

		<description><![CDATA[How &#039;bout that bus station reno, amazing. I&#039;m with you on the Victorian decor, I grew up in a home, circa the 1880&#039;s and we still had much of the original furniture. I like the simpler clean, almost rustic charm of the colonial era. Awaiting the next post.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Paula – Original furniture in an 1800′s house – wow! I think our taste for the simpler lines with a touch of rustic must be very similar. I seem to be able to find that more easily in North Carolina than in South Carolina. Thank you for visiting the blog and leaving your comment.
