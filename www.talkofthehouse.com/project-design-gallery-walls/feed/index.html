		<description><![CDATA[Your home is absolutely gorgeous!  Your photos add so much warmth!  Love all the details throughout....like your shelves in the dining room, the hallways....everything!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Goodness!  Thank you so much Annie!  That is so very sweet of you to say that.  I am happy you like our home.  It is well used and abused. :)

		<description><![CDATA[You have such a lovely home! I have been seeing so many blog posts about gallery walls lately and it makes me want to create some of my own! Unfortunately, an elaborate gallery wall is difficult to do when you&#039;re renting... One day!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Katie.  Renting does make it hard to be able to decorate the way you want.  Try command hooks for hanging your things.  They are supposed to be easy to remove.
