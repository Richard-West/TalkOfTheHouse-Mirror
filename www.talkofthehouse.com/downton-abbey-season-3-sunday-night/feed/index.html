		<description><![CDATA[Love this post Kelly...I am a HUGE Downton Abbey Fan. And like you, I tried to figure out my Christmas gifts and I have been known to read the last page first!! My reasoning was that I want to make sure I am pulling for the right people or I am disappointed.lol....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Arlene ‚Äì Another Downton girl! Yay! And I am glad to know that I am not the only one who tried to peek at gifts. Karen (gardenhomeandparty.com) and I have decided that we are just people who like to ‚Äúbe prepared.‚Äù Don‚Äôt you think that is a good way to look at it? :) I think your reason for sneaking a look at the last page of a book is a good one, too!
