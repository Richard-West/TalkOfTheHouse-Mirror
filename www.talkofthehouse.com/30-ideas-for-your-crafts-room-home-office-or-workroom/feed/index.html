		<description><![CDATA[Love the last room you featured.  That is my dream room.  How wonderful to craft, sew, read.....while being surrounded by nature.  I think it is my inner desire for that glassed in porch, I wish to still add on to our current home :( I had a small glassed porch with our first home.  I miss it.  Isn&#039;t it nice to have your own space now Kelly?  Your room turned out wonderful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Wasn&#039;t that room with all the windows just perfection??  Glad you loved it too.  I would like to glass in our porch (and add a fireplace while we are at it! :) )  Yes, it is quite wonderful to have my own space, but even more wonderful to have it all organized! LOL  Glad you liked the room.
