		<description><![CDATA[So nice to find your blog and read about Stowe, Vt. This is my home state and I only live a few minutes from Stowe. Thank you for sharing your beautiful &#038; inspiring photos of Stowe. So much to see &#038; do in all of our four seasons here in Stowe &#038; throughout this magnificent State. Happy to see you enjoy it!]]></description>
