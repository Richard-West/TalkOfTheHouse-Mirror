		<description><![CDATA[Peppermint all the way, all the time! Sometimes we have peppermint stick ice cream (from Boston-based Brigham&#039;s) with homemade hot fudge sauce as our Christmas dessert! I&#039;m also a HoJo&#039;s customer from back in the day, and I think that is where I fell in love with peppermint stick ice cream, but mint chocolate chip is probably my favorite nowadays.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last year Southern Living featured a recipe for the Christmas cake Layered Peppermint Cheesecake. There were two layers of peppermint cheesecake between three layers of sour cream cake. The cake was topped off with white chocolate mousse frosting. There were also instructions on how to make a peppermint plate for a truly impressive presentation. It was over-the-top fabulous and delicious. I recommend this recipe to all peppermint lovers or if you want a wow dessert for your Christmas dinner. My family is still talking about it!!]]></description>
