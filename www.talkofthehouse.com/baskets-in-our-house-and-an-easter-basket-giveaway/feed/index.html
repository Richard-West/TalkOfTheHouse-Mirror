		<description><![CDATA[I recently found your wonderful blog and am reading through all of your past entries.  So fun!  I have admired all of your baskets displayed in the entries I have read and wonder where you find most of your baskets, especially the flatter ones with handles.  Thank you.  Nancy

&lt;em&gt;Hi Nancy!  I am glad you found Talk of the House and are enjoying the posts.:)  I read your other comment about wanting another post on baskets.  I don&#039;t think there is a whole lot more to tell other than what was in the basket post.  The ones you are referring to (the tray type) came from little shops here and there many years ago, and most are not even in business still.  My favorite one, the one in the family room on top of the piece behind the wicker chair, came from a shop in Macon that I know has long gone out of business. I think this one at Tag though may be just like it. (I spray painted ours.)  http://www.tag2u.com/willow-rectangular-tray-large/202368l/product . I did just order this set from someone and am waiting on it to arrive:  http://www.ironaccents.com/109-lb8606.html .
Hope this helps!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
