		<description><![CDATA[I am with Katrina....not an animal person but it isn&#039;t my fault.  1.  As a child, my mom made me wash/scrub my hands after touching an animal.  2.  I was bitten by a dog as a child and was terribly afraid of them until the last few years.  But, you know what!  I love looking at dogs.  And, I love all of the dog art.  I actually buy lots of dog items to sale which shocks those who know me. (Yes, I allowed my children to have pets.)  And, when my daughter&#039;s fiancee told me he wanted to have his dog in their wedding, I was REALLY okay with that.  I will tie a big satin ribbon around her neck and admire from a distance.  And, if all goes as planned, Katrina&#039;s precious little granddaughter could be walking that dog down the aisle!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That is terrible that you were bitten by a dog!!  Oh my goodness.  I would be forever scared.  So it is amazing that you like looking at them and at dog art.  Good luck with the dog in the wedding!

		<description><![CDATA[Love all the dog art, especially the big white silhouette on brown, it could be my daughter&#039;s dog. I do not have any dogs right now, but keep a granddog ( and 2 grandchildren) every day while my daughter teaches. Phoebe is 12 and getting very senile,but she is the sweetest dog ever and since she was my daughter&#039;s first baby she has a special place in my heart.

&lt;em&gt;How sweet of you to do that, Martha!  Twelve years is a long time for a dog to live.
