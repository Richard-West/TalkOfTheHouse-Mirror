		<description><![CDATA[Love the tour, Kelly, that looks like an amazing place to stay. I&#039;m with you, though, a real community vs. resort development, community wins. Favorite beach: too many! I do love Cold Storage in Dennis, Massachusetts. Not fancy, a snug stretch of sand bordered by dunes. It&#039;s found at the end of a residential area filled with old (amazing) Cape homes. There&#039;s a small parking lot which really limits the amount of beachgoers to early risers and those who can walk in. Then, there&#039;s the beach on the other side of the Cape, West Yarmouth, where I spent part of every summer for many years. Oh, and must mention the South Carolina beaches of my married years&#039; vacations, Hilton Head and Litchfield Beach.]]></description>
