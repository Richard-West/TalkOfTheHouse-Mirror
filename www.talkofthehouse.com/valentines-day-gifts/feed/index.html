		<description><![CDATA[LOVE the ruler idea. Realizing that this was posted a year ago, do you remember yet where you purchased the cute rulers from? Thanks so much; please use my email if responding. Happy Day~

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Monica!  I am glad you liked the Valentine rulers.  I bought them at Target last year, but they do not seem to carry anything like them this year.  All I have been able to find there this season is tattoos. Oriental Trading has some rulers, but they are not red.  I hope you can find a source for them.
Have a happy Friday!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
