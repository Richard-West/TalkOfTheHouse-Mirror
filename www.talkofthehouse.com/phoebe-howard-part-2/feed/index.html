		<description><![CDATA[Phobe Howard&#039;s rooms do have a southern style to me . They all look beautiful as well as comfortable. I feel they are classic and will be rooms that will stand the test of time and not some fad that you will want to change in a couple of years.  
There are some really good designers with no formal training just a natural talent to know what looks good together. I love your blog.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yarlette â€“ I just wrote your exact thoughts to Paula! Goodness. Great minds must think alike! I am so glad you are enjoying the blog, since I am enjoying everyoneâ€™s comments.

		<description><![CDATA[Serene, lovely, and traditional; I think these rooms would do just fine in a classic New England colonial.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Paula â€“ You mean I canâ€™t hog all of these for a Southern house?  :) No, I am afraid you are right. They WOULD also fit beautifully in New England. I guess her gorgeous traditional style would work anywhere. Classics have stood the test of time, and I would call her rooms classic.
