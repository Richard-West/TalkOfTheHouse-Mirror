		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s time for an in-law outing to the beach, specifically mother- in- law and sister-in- law. My niece can join us too. Maybe even my brother.

&lt;em&gt;Oh that would be such fun!  Unfortunately, we are not retired like some people we know,and we had a difficult time trying to fit in this trip. But you could always make the trip down there and enjoy yourself as long as you would like.I bet you haven&#039;t been in years.
Thanks for reading and leaving your comment!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing the pictures. I love that I know exactly what you are talking about.  
OK I&#039;m doing my cousinly duty here and letting you know about my cousin&#039;s places they have for rent. I highly recommend either one, and not because they belong to family. They are really pretty and the house is right on the beach! Here are the links. 
I could describe every inch of this house! I spent many a day playing there!

This is a condo.

&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the links to the beach places, Jayne.  I will keep them in mind. That condo is at the Plantation! Ron mentioned how wonderful it is to stay there in a previous comment here.
