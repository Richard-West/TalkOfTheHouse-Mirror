		<description><![CDATA[Green beans your favorite food?  Being a teacher you may appreciate my story.  At a workshop first thing in the morning we were to record our favorite summer food.  At mid-morning break a woman introduced herself to me and said her maiden name was the same as mine, but we couldn&#039;t connect any relatives or locations to each other.  At lunch we were divided into groups by favorite summer foods.  Large groups of ice cream and watermelon and two loners, the green bean girls, yes the one with the same name and I both wrote down green beans! You could have joined us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That was hilarious!  Who would have ever thought?! :)
Thanks for sharing the story with all of us Becky. 
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
