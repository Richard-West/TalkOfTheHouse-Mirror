		<description><![CDATA[What great news, your daughter is going to have the time of her life interning at the most magical place! And, her apartment is pretty darn cute, I wouldn&#039;t mind rooming there. Hope you have that family reunion weekend very soon, something to look forward to. When I saw the picture with all the pots of riotously blooming flowers, I just assumed it was an archive photo from the Disney website. Oh my, I would love to see all that garden beauty right now. We are in our third weekend in a row of snow and will be going into July at this rate, to make up all the missed days. And, the worst of it, the temps have frequently been bitterly cold. How far behind can spring be???? Best Wishes to your lovely daughter on her new adventure!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;For your sake, and all of New England and the midwest,I hope spring arrives soon.  The weather you all have been enduring has been awful.  I can&#039;t imagine.   We are having one of our coldest nights in a long time tonight, but it is nothing compared to all the blizzards you have had.  Here is to warm sunny weather coming your way!

		<description><![CDATA[You all, are one busy family!  How exciting, Mom and Dad.  What a car load, for sure!  Well, it is just too fun here today...NOT!  A whole bunch of snow blowing, shoveling and cozy going on.  Midwest getting hit with a bunch of snow, winds and cold temps this coming week.  We&#039;ll see if they close schools tomorrow, though I don&#039;t have that to worry about these days.  Florida sounds, oh so nice about now.  Oh, your lucky daughter.  Good for her!  On the quiz I got, Tiana.  Checked off small town, live in a cottage, own a business, etc..Ha, That&#039;s my retirement dream...though I&#039;d be working part time at a coffee shop. :)  Ok, off I go, lets check out the super bowl half time and then on to Downton.
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Shoveling snow does not sound fun.  You all have certainly had more than your share of winter this year.  I hope Florida sunshine and warmth come your way soon.
