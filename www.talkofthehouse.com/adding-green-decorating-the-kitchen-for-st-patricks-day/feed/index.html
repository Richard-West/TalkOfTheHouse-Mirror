		<description><![CDATA[Love the green! I love all your curtains in different colorways. Do you make the curtains or do you have them made? Enjoyed the pictures very much, thanks for sharing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Glad you liked all the green Anita!  I do make most of the curtains.  The ones in the playroom and the boys room were ordered from Country Curtains (I did line them myself though). I have made pretty much all the others.

		<description><![CDATA[This is GREAT!!!!  I love the greens....
I like to decorate here and there for the holidays, but you have me beaten by a MILE...or THREE!!!  Too Cute!!
I think I could happily snitch a few of your ideas and let them play out all summer long :^)
Blessings,
J

&lt;em&gt;You go right ahead and snitch whatever you would like.  The green won&#039;t stay here through summer because I will be wanting red back by then.  Glad you liked all the green details though!
