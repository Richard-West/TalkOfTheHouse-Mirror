		<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, Kelly, once again you&#039;ve blown us all away.  What a lucky man Walter is to have you as a daugter-in-law.  So creative and thoughtful!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Lisa.  He was more than deserving of such a party.  He has been such a generous man all his life, and it was the least we could do to celebrate his 90th birthday.  :)  I&#039;m so glad you enjoyed reading about the party.  It was a very fun one to pull off!

		<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful surprise for your father-in-law! I know he has to love you to pieces! Everything was wonderfully planned and carried out! And, you were so thoughtful to include all of his favorite things! (This was not at all what DiAnne and I guessed...but that will come later, we are sure!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Much later!  I need to save some money for that! :)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
