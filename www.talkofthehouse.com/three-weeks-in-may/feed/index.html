		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly!  Just read this post.  We also just recently had our youngest graduate Nursing School at the Univ of Miami and our 3rd daughter complete grad school at the Univ of Chicago.  In just 3 weeks time we flew to both from our Texas home.  It was crazy but glorious!

Congrats on all the accomplishments!  It is a wonderful feeling for a parent!

&lt;em&gt;Wow, and I thought WE had it busy! I can‚Äôt imagine trying to fly all over the country for that too. Congratulations on your children‚Äôs accomplishments!

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, what a special post, Kelly!  I love the home decor posts, but sometimes, it is so nice to hear about what&#039;s really going on in someone&#039;s head, life and family.  Home decor is fun, but it is just something we do, it doesn&#039;t define who we are.  Thanks for opening up and sharing :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Lindsay, I so appreciate your comments. There was ALOT going on in my head, life and family this month. :) Glad you enjoyed reading all about it. Sometimes it is therapeutic to get it all out of my head and onto ‚Äúpaper.‚Äù
