		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Oh my goodness, I&#039;m so sorry to hear of your struggles with returning to 100% good health.
Christmas will undoubtedly provide the cure.  I loved your post and am thrilled for your son who just got accepted into Yale law school!  So much to be thankful for this season.
Best to you and your family!
xo,
Karen]]></description>
