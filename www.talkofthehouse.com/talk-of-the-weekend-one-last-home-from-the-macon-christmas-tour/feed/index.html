		<description><![CDATA[All I have to say is stunning! That house was quite lovely. Thank you for the wonderful tour. My favorite pictures by far were of the red bicycle, master suite, and master bath. First off, I loved the bike! What a festive but unorthodox idea! Very unique indeed. And the master suite, oh my! What a site it is! The bathroom is indeed perfection and I love that the laundry room is attached!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the pics of all the homes on tour...fun to see how the other half lives. 

If ever the day comes that all your friends desert you (never) or your family forsakes you (ha) or you find yourself &#039;lost&#039; in this world (double ha)...I&#039;ll be your best bud, your BFF, or your extra sister.  Your posts always lift my spirits and bring beauty into my world that needs more. Wishing you a belated joyful Christmas and a Happy and Healthy New Year.]]></description>
