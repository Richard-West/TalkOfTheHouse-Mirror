		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

We&#039;re lacking for closets and storage here too! I think the closet looks great. What I might suggest is to get one of those portable closets for the room above the garage for your extra linens and pillows. They&#039;d be protected and still accessible.
Good luck with all the organizing. You&#039;re my hero!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love what you did to the closet. I agree with you. Organized does mean being located in an area where you use it, making the most use of its space, easy access and attractive. Especially the attractive since I am very visual.
I have so many projects I want to work on it isn&#039;t even funny! Some days I wish I could just take everything out of my house and just start over. haha That will never happen! The guest/kids bathroom is in much need of a redo! Not only a redecorating but organizing to. I hate to open the cabinets and see all the cleaning products and medicines and such. My problem now is I have so many ideas (thanks to Pinterest) I can&#039;t decide which I want to use. lol
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I get to that point too Jayne...totally overwhelmed so much so that I don&#039;t know where to start.  It is like that saying, &quot;My brain has too many tabs open!&quot;  Writing it all down and prioritizing it seems to be the only way I can deal with all the zillions of ideas running around in my head.  :)
