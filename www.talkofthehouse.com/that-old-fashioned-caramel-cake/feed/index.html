		<description><![CDATA[This cake looks amazing! I totally get what you mean about cooking and chemistry... I&#039;m more a kind of &quot;freestyle cook&quot; ;-) so I need to be very disciplined when I begin a pastry recipe!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It tasted amazing too. :)  I agree with you.  Pastries do require more precision than other kinds of recipes.  (But I think it is perfectly fine to be a freestyle cook. LOL)

		<description><![CDATA[This cake looks and sounds yummy! :) I&#039;ll definitely try making it. I don&#039;t really think of myself as a particularly good baker but I seem to be lucky with cakes ...and pastry and they usually turn out well. You&#039;ve made me realise that I haven&#039;t made a cake in ages ... baking results in eating ...every last crumb :) and as I&#039;m trying hard with &quot;healthy eating&quot; at the moment ...sure you know what I mean! 
Daughter makes delicious lemon drizzle and coffee and walnut cakes ...my favourite! So I&#039;m usually guaranteed one on my birthday and Mother&#039;s Day! :)
Hope you&#039;re having a fun weekend ..we&#039;ve had some very cold but bright and sunny days here ...perfect for walking.
Rosemary

&lt;em&gt;If you can do pastry, then you ARE a baker Rosemary! I hope you will give the caramel cake a try soon...even if you are trying to eat healthy. :)  You can just walk more in your lovely weather to burn off the calories from it!  The lemon drizzle sounds delicious since I love anything with lemon. :)
