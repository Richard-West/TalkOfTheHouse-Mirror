		<description><![CDATA[Well, I see some rooms I absolutely could move right into... Nantucket love, I think. Thanks for the introduction to this designer, will have to keep an eye out in the future for more of his work. Hope the Fourth was enjoyable - we are waiting for the rain from the hurricane to pass on by. It&#039;s been a gloomy day, but the Bristol (R.I.) Fourth of July Parade, the oldest in the country, went off without a hitch. My friends are sailing for the week and are berthed at Nantucket, which is where the hurricane will come the closest to the New England coastline tonight. I hope they have a safe night.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am amazed the parade was able to go on. I would have thought all that hurricane weather would have rained out most things in your area.  So glad to know it didn&#039;t!  Hope your friends made it safely through the storm.  What a weekend for a hurricane!  My son was in Florida where the beaches were packed.  He was not too happy with that, but it certainly beat the rain in your area.  I guess we can dream of sunny days in Nantucket. :)
