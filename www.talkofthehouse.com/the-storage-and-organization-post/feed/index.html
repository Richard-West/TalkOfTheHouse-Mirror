		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I always look forward to your decorating posts and I have been thinking about your attic organization strategy since you originally shared this.  How did you decide to pack your bins by room and not type of item?  I tend to think in terms of rooms also, but I know others organize their decor by thing like berries, picks, stars, red items, etc.  Do you consistently decorate your rooms similarly for Christmas and not use items you use from other times of the year, like a star dish at Christmas and the fourth of July?  Thanks for your help.  I am trying to develop a formal system once and for all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly.  An argument has ensued at my house over the size of your red containers.  My husband thinks they are like big shoe box size.  I say they are big ones.  What say you?  Thanks.  It would be a shame to be feuding over this on our 38th anniversary-haha-coming up this month...]]></description>
