		<description><![CDATA[What a shame! We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary there in June 1995 and it was absolutely charming.  I recall the owners saying they were already completely booked for the dates of the following year&#039;s Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

We spent our honeymoon at another lovely place nearby, the Fairfield Inn, which was demolished in 1986.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Inn_(Cashiers,_North_Carolina)

Hate to see these places disappear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I hate to as well.  I remember the Fairfield Inn too.  We stopped there and visited the lake a number of times back in the early 80&#039;s.
So sad. :(

		<description><![CDATA[Sad to report that the Inn has been torn down. I visited there a few times over the years and always found it intriguing. After AIG lost the property it was purchased by a private owner, but sadly the years of sitting vacant while AIG owned it were its ruin. According to friends of ours who own a home in the community surrounding the Inn property, the new owners couldn&#039;t save it due to the wildlife living in it and the infestation of insects/rodents in those beautiful wood walls. So sad.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh...I had not thought about animals and insects in those wood walls.  That is sooo sad.  What a waste of a beautiful beautiful building.  I just hate that.
