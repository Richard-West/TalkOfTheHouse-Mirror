		<description><![CDATA[I love going on your virtual road trips, Kelly.
Waterbury is a college town so it definitely has a different vibe from Stowe. It&#039;s interesting that you picked that up in the summer when it probably is quieter than usual.

&lt;em&gt;Oh, I forgot it was a college town.  That certainly does make a difference in your target audience in a place when you want to draw in business.  That makes more sense to me now.  Thanks for pointing that out Christi!
