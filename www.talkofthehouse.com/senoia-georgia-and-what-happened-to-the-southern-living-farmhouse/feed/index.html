		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Debra.  When I saw that the farm house sat across from a row of townhouses, it sort of ruined it.  
Thank you for your posts-look forward to them every week!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I remember this house well...I think I pinned every single photograph because there wasn&#039;t one room I didn&#039;t like.  I&#039;m happy the house has a family to keep it now.
xo,
Karen

&lt;em&gt;It is a pretty house, and some lucky family is getting to enjoy it now.  That is rare to find a house in which you like every single room!  I think that speaks to the comfortableness of the rooms.
