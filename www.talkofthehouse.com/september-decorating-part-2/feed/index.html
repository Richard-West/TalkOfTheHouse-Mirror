		<description><![CDATA[I just came across your blog on Pinterest. I absolutely love your style of decorating. I felt compelled to write because, like so many other readers, You&#039;ve Got Mail is my favorite movie of all time! So many memorable lines.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am so glad you found the blog Beth!  Welcome!  And I am happy you liked the September decorating.  You&#039;ve Got Mail is such a fun movie, and I think there are quite a few of us that love it...from the houses to the lines to the plot. Please visit again!

		<description><![CDATA[One of my very favorites. My kids and I still say, &quot; the Godfather is answer to any question&quot;.  Terrible we know the lines to that!  
For some reason I am not getting your emails.  Came by this morning just because I was browsing my favorite places for eye candy. And as always, you never fail to make me smile.  I have to ask where you purchased those delightful red bows and those beautiful heavy water goblets.  
Hope you are enjoying your weekend.  Thank you for the inspiration!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Knowing the lines is not terrible.  If it was, I think a lot of us would be in the same boat with you!  The red bowls came from Pier 1 years ago, and the water goblets are the Tag bubble glass goblets from Amazon.  I don&#039;t know how to help on the delivery of the email of the blog.  Feedburner is being a pain!  Try signing up with Bloglovin.  It&#039;s free and it seems to do a better job.
Thank you for your sweet comments!
