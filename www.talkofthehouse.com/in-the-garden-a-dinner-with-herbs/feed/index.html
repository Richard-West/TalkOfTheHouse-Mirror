		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
 I was driving myself bonkers for days, trying to remember were I saw the idea to plant geraniums &#038; herbs together in the past couple of weeks. I remembered that I liked this idea to add some color to my herb pots &#038; still have be utilizing them as a decorative &#038; useful at the same time. It was that I had purchased or received garden magazines or books, &#038; also about the same time all the bloggers I read had a gardening theme going on. Seriously, I could picture all your pics but for the life of me could not remember where. Took my teen to say, &quot;Well if you didn&#039;t totally delete the email, do a search under herb &#038; geranium &#038; see what pops up&quot;. Can we say  &quot;DUH&quot;, it was the second post in the search. And yes, I&#039;m just getting to planting now....May this year was having bouts of cold snaps, &#038; this gal only plants once. So now that the big pot mystery is solved, pots, &#038; yes the veggie garden will finally get planted. A little late, but fingers crossed winter won&#039;t be in such a hurry to come back. Now on another note I also like Timeless Setting. Thanks for mentioning them. I too appreciate the fact that you don&#039;t advertise many stores. I really enjoy your blog for the simple fact that you always write about your home or places, or your projects.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh dear!  Cynde, I am sorry it was driving you crazy.  Glad you found the post.  I am also glad you commented about this though.  I notice that some bloggers pin the same image over and over again on Pinterest, and I have always thought that was crazy (to the point of being annoying.)  But if I had pinned an image from the post more than once, you might have more easily found it (if you happen to follow the blog there.)  I will keep that in mind.  
I do think the late cold everywhere has had an affect on planting.  My father&#039;s vegetable garden is going to be harvested much later this year.  Good luck with all your planting!

		<description><![CDATA[I was skepital about looking at another online store.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I would have a hard time picking one or two favorite things, because I saw a lot of neat things that I could use in my home or give to my hard to buy for mother! I will certainly tell other about Timeless Settings. Your posts always inspire me and I appreciate all the hard work you put into your blog! Happy summer to you!]]></description>
