		<description><![CDATA[Perry is a really darling little town, how lucky you are to have so much so close to home.  My town has less than 300 people in it even though we are the county seat.  We are pretty excited at the moment that the local watering hole has changed hands and will be opening as a steak house and lounge this coming weekend.  We&#039;ve been without a local eating establishment for a couple of years now so it&#039;s a BIG deal for everyone around here.  They plan to have home style cooking so it sounds wonderful and we can&#039;t wait to give them a try!  I have to also second Theresalh&#039;s vote for the Drover in Omaha, NE.  I&#039;ve been there several times over the years since I used to live there!  She is also correct in saying there are lots of great places to eat there...I think there is an average of one eating establishment in that city for every ten people!  Crazy!!]]></description>
