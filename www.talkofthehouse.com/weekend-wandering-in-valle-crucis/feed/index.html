		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,  Your visit to the Mast Country Store reminds me of our visit there about 30 years ago.  It hasn&#039;t changed at all.  And since I&#039;m on a Mitford kick, it could be the old country store that Absalom Greer had a ways out of town. Father Tim visited him a few times at that old country store with the dark wood floors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh yes, the old country store with the dark wood floors.  The description of Brother Greer&#039;s store in the books matches Mast General Store perfectly (except I don&#039;t recall seeing any room in the back in which someone would live.)
I am glad you got to visit the store long ago.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for letting us tag along on your trip. Loved seeing all the beautiful and interesting places you visited. What a sweet husband for thinking about what you would truly enjoy.
P.S. - True confession....I had to look up what scuppernong is. Thanks, teacher! I learned something.  :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You are more than welcome, Jill!  My husband is certainly a sweetie - and a very patient man.  Glad you now know what a scuppernong is.  Are you familiar with muscadines?  If not, look them up too. :) (I like them better.)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
