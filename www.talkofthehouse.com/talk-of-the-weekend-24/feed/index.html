		<description><![CDATA[What a great post!   The banana splits in the jars look soooo. good.    I am reading MKA&#039;s book Savannah Breeze.   Love her books.  Yes Kathy, Josie needs to get herself retired.  Love that car!
Enjoy your company.

&lt;em&gt;I am so glad you enjoyed it DiAnne!  I would love to have one of those banana split treats right now.  Yum! I need to get another MKA book to read, but I can&#039;t seem to put them down once I start them...and that makes me keep reading until the wee hours of the morning. Not good.  Wasn&#039;t that car just the cutest thing?!I had to find a post to put it in. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Why couldn&#039;t this be our week at Pawleys Island, Anita??? 
Another fun post, Kelly! I am so glad you retired! (Now, if Josie would just retire!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am glad to be retired too, but I still can&#039;t seem to keep up with the comments here.  I have got to start having &quot;regular hours&quot; to work on the blog. (But in the summer, my brain does not seem to understand &quot;regular hours.&quot; LOL)
