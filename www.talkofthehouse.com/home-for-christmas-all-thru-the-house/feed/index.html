		<description><![CDATA[Just Love your warm and cozy look. Where did you purchase all of your Buffalo Plaid red, black, and taupe drapes?  Can&#039;t wait to see what you do for Spring. Happy New Year
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Linda.  I made almost all of the drapes.  The ones in the playroom and in our daughterâ€™s room came from Country Curtains.  I lined them and added some trim to the panels.  I made all the other drapes in the house.  If you will click on the FAQ tab at the top of the blog, it will take you to the page that should have all of the fabric sources listed.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Taking a moment before the craziness of Christmas Day starts to browse through some of my fave bloggers&#039; pages and just had to comment on yours. In an era where store perfection seems to be the goal, your house is a welcome oasis. All I kept thinking as I looked through your pics was &quot;I would love to visit her!&quot;  No all white scaring people to make themselves comfy, books with spines facing out so you can read titles and choose one, sofas without too many pillows, and furniture arranged for living. All this done with finesse and taste. Love everything about your home. Thanks for sharing. Merry Christmas!

&lt;em&gt;Goodness!  Thank you for such a kind comment Maggie.  I know exactly what you are speaking of with the white sofas, books turned around on the shelves, and a million pillows filling every seating spot in the house.  It is unreal the things that magazines and shows think we should live with.  A house is for living...and that is what we do here...with a lot of red! LOL  I am glad you enjoy seeing the photos of it.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year wishes to you. :)
