		<description><![CDATA[Where did you get that bathroom vanity and mirror?! I love it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Are you asking about the ones in my husband&#039;s office?  The vanity is one he built to look like a small table, and the mirror came from Lowes. Glad you liked them!

		<description><![CDATA[I love your couch!  I have been looking for one just like that and am wondering where you found yours?  Love your website, my favorite by far!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Susan, I am afraid that couch is over 10 years old.  It was made by Highland House and was originally red.  I had it recovered a year or so ago in this fabric:  http://lsfabrics.com/fabric/perth-24  (Perth by Kaufmann.)
Hope this helps!
