		<description><![CDATA[Hi, really enjoying your site.  I have a little robin who visit&#039;s the bird feeder outside my kitchen window, so my husband treated me to a Emma Bridgewater robin mug, my daughter Elona has the puffins one, as we stay beside the sea on the east coast of Scotland. On a walk on Doon hill above Dunbar we saw four goldfinch&#039;s so I have sent off for that one for my husband. More of a Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens fan myself.  Although, probably biased the BBC does British period drama best.
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I would have to agree that the BBC does British period drama the best (and I LOVE British comedies as well!)  I am jealous of your Bridgewater mugs.  One day I will have some pieces of her pottery.  Enjoy yours!
