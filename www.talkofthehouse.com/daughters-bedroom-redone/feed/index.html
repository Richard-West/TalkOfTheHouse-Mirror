		<description><![CDATA[you said the bunk beds were pottery barn? I couldn&#039;t find where you said those were from. 

I have been wanting some just like that!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Sorry, Stephanie.  The bunkbeds are not Pottery Barn...the linens are.  I purchased those beds on a close-out special from a local furniture store.  (I don&#039;t even remember the name of the brand.)  The beds were an ivory color when we purchased them, and I painted them white.  They are very similar to the Catalina bunkbeds at PBKids.  http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/catalina-bunk-bed/?pkey=dbunk-beds&amp; Good luck finding the beds you want!
