They are very user friendly.  While looking for ideas i came across this blog on blogging, that I&#039;m shocked I missed. Let me start by saying I am so proud of you and your blog. You know I&#039;ve been your number one fan since you posted your very first blog!  You are so talented in so many ways. Your character is impeccable and your thoughts, ideas, and pictures are inspiring and refreshing!  With that being said,  I&#039;ve told you from day one you should be making money from your talent.  I am so glad to hear you say that you finally are....I did have a slight heart attack at the beginning but your gift as a writer sucked us all in and kept us reading til the end!  Thank you for doing what you do.  xoxo]]></description>
