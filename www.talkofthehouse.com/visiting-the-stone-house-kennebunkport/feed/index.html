		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

The Stone House has been my favorite house since 1981 when my husband,(now deceased) and I use to stay at The Colony!! We spent our short honeymoon there and continued going for years!  I met Vice President Bush on his way out after breakfast one morning! My husband took photos but was so excited they all came out blurred! We would bike ride pass Walkers Point and The Stone House and fantasize living there!! I&#039;m alone now and have not been back for years!I MISS Kennebunkport, The Colony and especially my beloved Stone House!!  I noticed they have added an addition/Guest House!  Please don&#039;t think me MAD, BUT do they need a caretaker??  I have an impeccable personal resume plus even a PERFECT driving record! One of the items on my bucket list is to stay at The Stone House a few nights! Well Kelly, I can dream can&#039;t it???? Please throw a kiss the next time you go by &quot;my&quot; Stone House!  Blessings!! Billie Ann Lawlor, Enfield CT]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
I just stumbled on your feature of our home, The Stonehouse in Kennebunkport, Maine. So glad you like it! I would love to talk with you by phone when you have a minute so I can ask you a couple of questions and can verify that our home  WAS completely restored in 2011- 2012! Just leave me a message with your number and a good time to call if you miss me.
Best,
Ashley

&lt;em&gt;Wow Ashley!  You are so lucky to own the Stonehouse!  Just being in Kennebunkport is wonderful enough, but that house...oh my goodness!  I will be glad to answer any questions you might have (and I will go back and verify the restoration in 2011 now) but I would prefer to do it using email.  A blog is quite public enough, but I try to maintain some privacy here since I have a teenage daughter.  Hope you understand that. 
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
