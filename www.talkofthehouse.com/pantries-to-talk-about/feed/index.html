		<description><![CDATA[Well, now I am drooling!! I did change around some things in mine thanks to your post. :) I&#039;ll have to wait to paint after Easter though. I have an additional closet in our garage converted to family room I call the &quot;freezer closet&quot; which has a floor freezer, shelves for small appliances, extra dishes, cookbooks, etc. It has a lot of room, but it needs cleaning out too! :P
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yay!  So glad you could get some organization done Gina. :)  Your freezer closet sounds like it is large and handles quite a few duties!  I doubt it is fun to clean, but it does sound like a good storage space.
Have a great weekend!
