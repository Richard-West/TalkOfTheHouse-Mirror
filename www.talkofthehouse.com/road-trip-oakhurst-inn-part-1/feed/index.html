		<description><![CDATA[Oakhurst Inn looks and sounds wonderful. Thanks for the virtual tour! I remember a certain hotel that my family and I stayed in on a trip to Florida. That was in the day of brochures, the ones that show a picture perfect pool and accommodations. Needless to say, we got none of the picturesque, and many things that nightmares are made of.  We left the hotel at four in the morning as fast as we could!  So, I am very picky to the point of being persnickety! Your trip sounds wonderful.  Can&#039;t wait to see the rest! Love the details!!

&lt;em&gt;Sherry, that is terrible about your Florida hotel!  I am so thankful today there are websites with reviews from real people who have stayed there.  Management photos can make something look very good when it isn&#039;t.  I would say that I am right there with you in the &quot;persnickety&quot; category. :)  More of our trip coming soon. :)

		<description><![CDATA[I also think you would be a wonderful travel agent. Lovely place, made me want to visit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Well I do hope you have an opportunity to visit there one day Linda.  It is a great inn. I think being a travel agent would be a very fun job! (But not as fun as being the traveler! :) )
