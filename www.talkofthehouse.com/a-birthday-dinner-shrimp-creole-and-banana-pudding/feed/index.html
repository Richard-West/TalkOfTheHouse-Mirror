		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly, 
I love your blog.  It&#039;s so inspiring.  The meal you prepared looks delicious.  I was wondering if you could tell me about the bread basket you used to serve the French bread. What a lovely way to serve bread.  Can you share where you got the basket?  Thank you for the inspiration!
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I believe that basket came from Pottery Barn a couple of summers ago.  It IS perfect for serving bread.  (I looked for a long time to find one like that.) I bet PB still has a similar one available in their stores (or perhaps online.)
Have a great weekend Sheena!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
