		<description><![CDATA[My favorite character is actually... Mitford itself.  I think the town, made up of all the wonderful personalities, homes and seasons is in and of itself a character. When I feel like I need to be grounded again, I escape to Mitford. My favorite &quot;staycation&quot;. Thank you, Ms. Karon, for the beautiful gift of Mitford. I&#039;m forever grateful.
----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I would agree with you, Teresa.  Mitford is definitely one of the main characters in the series!  I think that is why we missed it so much when other books by Ms. Karon took us to different locations.  We always wanted to be at home in Mitford. :)
