		<description><![CDATA[This has me so ready for our vacation with children and grandchildren at Emerald Isle (Outer Banks of NC) in less than two weeks. I so love beach houses and this one is lovely...I like it better than their big one too, but I know how you need room as your family gets bigger. This year for the first time we are staying in the same house we had last year...our quest for the perfect house...big enough...safe enough for little ones....private pool....on beach....seems to be over. I know that as our 6 grandchildren get older we will have a quest to get closer to action, but right now we enjoy the lazy, quiet wonder of beach living.]]></description>
