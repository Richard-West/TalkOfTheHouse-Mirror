		<description><![CDATA[My Family and I love Paula Deen&#039;s recipies and she has designed beautiful furniture that we are in the process of purchasing. I would very much like to know if there is a way that a set of design/building plans for one of the cottages at the River House could be purchased? Thank You]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that Paula!!! I have been up to her house (both) every time we go to Savannah. I always wave to the security camera. Have two signed books and have met her family at a book signing in Savannah. To me she is as real as they come, not to mention sooooo pretty---love her hair. Been to &quot;The Lady &#038; Sons&quot; twice and was so good.Met her sons there once. We live in Knoxville, Tn. and have not yet gotten to her new restaurant in Pigeon Forge. Hopefully that will be soon. Haven&#039;t watched to much of the Food Network since they canceled her show. Paula, hope to run across you again in person

&lt;em&gt;Wow Shirley!  I would say you are a BIG fan!  How lucky that you have scoped out Paula&#039;s house, met her family, and been to her restaurants.  I hope you get to the new restaurant in Pigeon Forge soon, AND that you run into Miss Paula as well!  Good luck!
