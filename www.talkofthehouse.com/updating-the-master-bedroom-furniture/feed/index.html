		<description><![CDATA[I have an inherited antique mahogany highboy that I don&#039;t know what to do with.  Do not want to get rid of it.  No room to put it in dining room, living room, master bedroom or foyer.  Just moved it to the guest bedroom and bought a gray upholstered bed with silver nailhead trim.  I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s going to work.  Any ideas?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Take a look at this bedroom from an HGTV Dream Home back in 2011:  http://www.hgtv.com/design/hgtv-dream-home/2011/hgtv-dream-home-2011-master-bedroom-pictures-pictures  I don&#039;t know if you want to paint it, but the look would work even if you didn&#039;t.  Just go with that color scheme in there, and I think it would look pretty.  (I&#039;m not brave enough to paint ours yet.)
Hope this helps!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
