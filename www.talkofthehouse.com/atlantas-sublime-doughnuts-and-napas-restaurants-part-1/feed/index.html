  My husband got up early and drove across town to a bakery and go us fresh donuts for our breakfast as well! I love their blueberry cake donuts! Then we meet my parents and his parents at the lake house and had a wonderful late lunch together. It was a beautiful and relaxing day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

I have so enjoyed seeing your post about your trip to Napa.  We have wonderful friends who go there every fall.  They are wine connoisseurs!  In fact, we had some Napa wines last night at their house.  I sent them the link to your blog and they loved it.  They have never stayed in the cabins before and are very interest.  Thank you so much for sharing.]]></description>
