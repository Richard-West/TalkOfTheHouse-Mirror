		<description><![CDATA[Just finding your site...love it!  As for the lizard, if still a problem, I have a solution.  We used to have the same lizard problem at a camper we had &quot;parked in the mountains.  An &quot;ol-timer&quot; told me to sprinkle crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper around the outside of my screen porch.  It worked! I went to the dollar store and bought large, cheap bottles of both and sprinkled around the outside  and the little varmint stayed away.  I have been told this works for snakes too, as they spice &quot;burns&quot; their skin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly...there is something so magical about your porch...it is one that always wants you to come in and sit and never want to leave...So crushing on the chalkboards and the color of the frames...one of my favs!..the entire color scheme of your home is truly my favorite..and must say that your handwriting is magnificent!..
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you again for such kind words.  I love the porch too, but would love it more if Lizard would leave.:)  I have been sharpening my chalk in an old school pencil sharpener lately, and it has made writing on chalkboards so much easier.  I can&#039;t believe the difference it has made!
Enjoy your weekend!
