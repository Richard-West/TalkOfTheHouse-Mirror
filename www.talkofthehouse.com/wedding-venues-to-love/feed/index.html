		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly.
I&#039;ve read your wonderful blog from afar (first in Saudi Arabia and now Dubai where I work). Throughout, it has been a beacon in the desert which always brightened a day. Whilst sad to know you&#039;ll be going, I&#039;m glad to have read and enjoyed your blog and wish you and your husband well in this next thrilling adventure.
