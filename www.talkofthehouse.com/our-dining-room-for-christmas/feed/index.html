		<description><![CDATA[Every time I see what you&#039;ve done I get a pang of jealousy! How can one person have so many great ideas and the energy to actually do them?? Lol! Love the black gingham napkins! They are perfect with your dishes! I had planned on making gingerbread houses this year but sadly time has run out! Maybe next year? Merry Christmas!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f384.png" alt="ðŸŽ„" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
