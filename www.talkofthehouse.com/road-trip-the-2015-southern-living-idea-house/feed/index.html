		<description><![CDATA[Oh Kelly the last area rug made this old nurse think of EKGs!!lol...love the exterior as well. And the blue and white plates. I use three blue and white plates as my back splash behind my cook top.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Too funny!  Yes, I can see the similarity there. ::)  There are so many blue and white things out there.  It would be dangerous if I started to collect that...so I am staying away from it here.  (I would get sucked into buying everything I see too easily!)

		<description><![CDATA[Gosh,is it just me or does the artwork leave one a bit flat?  The house is fabulous, really and truly, but some of the artwork doesn&#039;t capture me.  I don&#039;t mean to be critical, but gosh such a gorgeous house and the artwork makes me a bit gloomy???
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I am absolutely no judge of what makes something artistic.  It really has to be personal in nature I think, so choosing it is hard.  The only paintings I seem to ever be drawn to are landscapes of marshes in the low country.  Strange, right?  So what may appeal to one person, may turn off another person.
