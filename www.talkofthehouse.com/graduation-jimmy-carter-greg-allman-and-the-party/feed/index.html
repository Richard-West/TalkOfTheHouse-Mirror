		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
What a lucky  group of graduates to have Jimmy Carter be their speaker.  I think they might remember all of this.
What a lovely party for your daughter!   I am so happy you were blessed with good weather.    
I knew you were busy with life.   May has always been crazy town around our house.  I missed you though.]]></description>
