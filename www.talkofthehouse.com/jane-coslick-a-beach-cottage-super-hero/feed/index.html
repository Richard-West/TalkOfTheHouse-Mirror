		<description><![CDATA[I have followed Jane for years and went to the last two tours of homes in December to see these lovely gems in person.  I came to your blog from hers!  Jane is truly an inspiration to anyone who loves color....which I certainly do.

&lt;em&gt;Thank you for coming over from Jane&#039;s site Connie.  That was so sweet of Jane to share my blog there.  Lucky you getting to see all those cute cottages dressed up for the holidays!  If she does it again this year, I think I am going to have to fit a trip to Tybee in my December schedule. :)  She certainly is inspirational!
