		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I had never thought of doing a Christmas globe using mason jars - very creative! I love food in mason jars too, but I usually love to eat way too much and would probably end up eating 2 mason jars worth of stuff!!! haha I&#039;m so glad you weren&#039;t hurt by the fire! I bet that was a very eventful afternoon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness ~ I just got back over here to your blog. When you mentioned &quot;the fire&quot; I scrolled down until I saw the post about it. Thankful your home is fine. BTW, my son is a career firefighter and works wildland fires in the summer. He spent several weeks in Eastern WA this past fire season. I have a special spot in my heart for firefighters, career and volunteer. They are caring, brave people! Love all the mason jar ideas, too. My favorite flower vase is an old blue mason jar.]]></description>
