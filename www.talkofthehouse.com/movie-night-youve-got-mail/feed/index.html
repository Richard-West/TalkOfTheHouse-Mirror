		<description><![CDATA[OM-Goodness!!!!  This is my favorite movie of all times. I watched it the first time in fall 2004....just before my separation and divorce. I must have watched it over 300 times in the year that followed. NO KIDDING! I may not have watched it all the way through each time, but it was on almost every evening. It kept me company and comforted me somehow. The GREAT music, the warm &#038; inviting interiors (Most of my decorating now mimics Kathleen Kelly&#039;s home, it&#039;s a perfect &quot;feel-good&quot; environment)....and those WONDERFUL quotes! Well, suffice to say I could pretty much recite the movie by the end of that year. 10 years later, I still watch it 3-4 times a year. 

Thanks to Gail for posting the text from the &quot;All we needed to know&quot; poster!

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely one of my all times favourites too! One thing I&#039;d never noticed until looking at the photos you&#039;d posted, was the placement of the furniture in Kathleen&#039;s place. The bed and her desk in particular - not all around the edges of a room - really nice. Have a lovely day. x
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It did have unusual furniture arrangements, didn&#039;t it?  I wonder if that was to accommodate all the cameras, or did they really just want the rooms to look like that?  The bed at an angle was very different to me, and I like the desk out in the middle of that area.  You&#039;ve got a good eye for spotting that! :)
