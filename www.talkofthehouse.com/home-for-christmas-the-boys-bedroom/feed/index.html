		<description><![CDATA[I have been with my mom and have been saving the Christmas posts to read on my computer. I love, love, love this post! Did you see the Fixer Upper show where Joanna hung a vintage bicycle in the office of one of the houses? If I had a place to hang a bicycle, I certainly would! Nancy&#039;s comments above reminded me of a bicycle story. One summer when my sister and I returned from summer camp, my parents had two beautiful new bicycles in the den waiting to surprise us. I immediately jumped on one while me sister sat down on the couch with a sad look. (She thought one bike was for me and the other for our older brother.) I have thought about the implications of that a lot. (I hope it means that my cup is half-full and not that I think I am entitled.) I love the bicycles on the tree and I covet that bicycle on the wreath. I know Katrina must also love it because she loves bicycles too! Kelly, you are just too clever!!!]]></description>
