		<description><![CDATA[Phew! I am worn out just reading about all the goings-on around your house. Sounds like it&#039;s been a quite an August. Sending belated bday greetings to you and your daughter, all those cakes looked amazing! I&#039;m so glad you received the cute bowls before summer was over - more ice cream days, ahead! You must be looking forward to a little break for Labor Day, hope you have that Friday off, too. (And, we haven&#039;t even gone back to school yet...) Speaking of Susan Branch, she just kicked off a nation-wide tour for her latest book, A Fine Romance, and I got to go and hear her speak. Being a longtime fan it was a great experience that the Sandwich, Mass. library put on. They even served cake and cookies made from the recipe in her books. Hope things are a little quieter for you for awhile, looking forward to the decorating reveal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Aw man...I am so very jealous that you got to hear Susan Branch!  I suppose you know that she wrote a post about that visit on her blog?  I wonder if you are in any of the photos?  Her reaction at the start of the post was so funny...thinking that no one was there because it was so quiet! Have you read her new book? 
Thank you for the birthday wishes.  I am afraid we only have Monday off, but we do have a cookout for lunch at school on Friday.  So that will be fun (an awfully nice of the guys who come to cook for us.) 
Thanks for the comment on the post!
Kelly &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Hi Jennifer!  Another August birthday - yippee! I hope yours was a fun one.  At 41, you are just a baby!  LOL.  My husband thinks I do better with a schedule, too, but I am not so sure.  Glad you liked the bowls.  (But they are better with ice cream in them! :))
