		<description><![CDATA[Good gracious, Kelly.  What a time you have had (so badly wanted to say when it rains it pours!)  Empty nest is certainly a new phase in life, but I must say, as the mother of an only child, I just couldn&#039;t imagine what life would be like.  Those college years go so quickly and before long they will be returning with spouses and children…it&#039;s just the best!!  Wishing you a week of calm…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMG, you have had your share of mishaps! Hopefully they will all pass. Hope the guys will have a safe travels. I remember when my son left for Washington State. My husband and I called him on the phone every couple of hours. My heart was broken being a empty nester but nervous about him driving by himself clear across country. He is in the Navy so he had to report within a certain amount of days. He said Washington State is a beautiful state but it rained a lot there. I wish your son&#039;s much success in there new life in Washington. Enjoy your time with your husband as a empty nester. May your next several weeks remain calm for you and the rest of your family. &#060;3]]></description>
