		<description><![CDATA[I too searched for more info on the Lake House, Upstate Lake House - New York and kept finding the same images. I did find the best images on the architect&#039;s site, http://www.pearsondesigngroup.com/projects/lake/upstate-lake-camp/
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, that does seem to be the only source of them.  Someone somewhere said it is a rental, but I think if that were the case, we would be able to find more photos of it.  So I don&#039;t think that is right.  Thanks for looking Jean!
