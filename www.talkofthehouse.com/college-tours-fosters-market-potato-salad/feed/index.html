		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m here, I&#039;m here!!! 
So sorry it took so long! 
I want to add you to my sidebar but it won&#039;t let me add any...I need to ask somebody to help. 
Well...is that you in the picture up top? Or your daughter? Because you are so YOUNG to have kids in college! 
I have my first heading off this fall...ohhhh meee!!! HELP. 
I always dreamt I&#039;d send my boys to summer camps in North Carolina..what is it about that place? :)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Phyllis, you are so funny! I have a monumentally busy weekend, but I am so glad I checked my comments this morning to get a good laugh here. :) Glad you are here. I would love for you to add me to your sidebar‚Ä¶so get some help! The picture above ‚Äúhello‚Äù is me, but the picture from the back (walking at Wake Forest) is my daughter‚Ä¶so not sure which one you are referring to. I‚Äôve been told we look alike, but I think it is the hair‚Ä¶.BUT she just died hers dark this week (boo hoo) for the role of Mulan in a musical. Hopefully she will go blonde again for the summer.
Good luck with your child heading to college. Sending the boys off was not quite as challenging as sending a girl off. Boys didn‚Äôt care about dorm stuff ‚Äì mom picked it out. A girl has an opinion on EVERYTHING ‚Äì down to the last detail. That when I yell HELP!
NC is gorgeous‚Ä¶that‚Äôs what it is about the place to me.

		<description><![CDATA[I love NC...we went to a wedding recently in the Highlands and it was gorgeous!  I could get used to the weather up there and the fact that they have no gnats!  Where did your daughter decide to go to school?  I only looked at colleges in state bc the HOPE scholarship was such a great deal (my parents were thankful :)  I ended up at UGA and loved every minute of it - husband went to AU, so needless to say we are a house divided in the fall!  Have a great weekend!  PS.  I always check out the desserts first, too!

&lt;em&gt;Hi Katie! Highlands IS beautiful. I used to love going there all the time, but since the Old Edwards Inn folks have bought up all of the town it has lost a little of its ‚Äúsmall town‚Äù appeal. Was the wedding you attended out at the farm of the Old Edwards Inn? That is a gorgeous place.
