		<description><![CDATA[Not only have you surely brought joy to your family, but also to those of us that get to peek inside your beautiful home. Truly the warmest home in Blogland.

&lt;em&gt;Lori, that HAS to be one of the nicest compliments I&#039;ve ever received about our home!  Thank you so much.  Many wishes to you for a wonderful new year!

		<description><![CDATA[Amen and very well said. Happy New Year!  The house is just lovely inside and the outside shows yâ€™all hard work this past year.
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Linda!  You can certainly see some of the exterior painting, but I am afraid there is more to go.  Here&#039;s to finishing all the house projects in 2018! Happy New Year to you! :)
