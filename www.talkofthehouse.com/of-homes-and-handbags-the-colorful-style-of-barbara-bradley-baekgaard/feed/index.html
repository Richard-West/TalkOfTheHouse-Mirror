		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I loved this whole post, especially the Birdie Cottage.  I bought a couple of old chairs @ a thrift store that look a little like the four on the porch of that cottage.  I love the big checks cushions so I may just have to work on those chairs and get some big cushions made for them.  The video introduction was great.  Don&#039;t you just love a story where someone takes $250 and builds a successful brand from it.   She seems so down to earth.   Have a good weekend.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing these Kelly. I love the porches especially and the cute bedrooms set out with lots of beds or bunks. I imagine extended families holidaying together and then all the children having nightly slumber parties after a day playing on the beach! :) I&#039;d love a home with a room like this ...maybe for grandchildren one day!! Not that any of our present bedrooms are big enough and I don&#039;t envisage moving anytime soon! A girl can dream! 
Hope you&#039;re having a good weekend. Our weather gone from heavy rain that caused the river to flood to dull and foggy ..then today it was beautiful, sunny and warm. Felt like Spring!
