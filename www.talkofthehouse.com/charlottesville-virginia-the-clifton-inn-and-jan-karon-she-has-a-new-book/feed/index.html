		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly
I love the Charlottesville area.  We have been twice, and stayed once at the Boar&#039;s Head Inn which is lovely.  The other trip was a stay at the Greenbrier in WV, with a day stop in C&#039;ville to see Monticello.  I will add this post to my &quot;vacations&quot; pin board and hope we get to go back for a return visit.

&lt;em&gt;Thanks for pinning from the post.  I hope you get to go back there for a visit soon! It looks like a lovely place to stay.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I stayed at the Boar&#039;s Head Inn.  It was lovely and the grounds were beautiful. I just wanted to stay put and enjoy versus seeing all the sights. Enjoyed walking the UVA campus and Thomas Jefferson&#039;s influence.  Of course, it was fun to shop and eat lunch at one of the many places that is across from the campus.  I don&#039;t think it is possible to see all there is in the surrounding areas with the presidential homes, antique shops, and other points of interest scattered in and around the town in one weekend.  I would love to go back for another weekend.]]></description>
