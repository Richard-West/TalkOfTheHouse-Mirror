You are quickly becoming my favorite blog. I love your colors and your home. Any ideas where to find this cookbook? I&#039;m a cookbook addict! We love red velvet cake around here but mine never turn out. My husband&#039;s aunt makes a mean red velvet and she is the expert. I need to go spend some time with her. We also need some help with chicken and dumplings. If you make those, I&#039;d love your recipe. A great southern favorite.]]></description>
