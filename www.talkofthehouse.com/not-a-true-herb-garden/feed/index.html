&lt;em&gt;Robin – I’m so glad you found my blog (and I found your wonderful pinterest boards!!) Thank you for your kind words about the garden and house. I see on your site that you are an artist. I need to tell my mother about you and your work. She is a painter too! (although not professionally) Please come back and visit here again!
