		<description><![CDATA[I have always wanted to go to Maine and Vermont.  I am so excited by all of your posts.  They have really brightened my spirits.  You take such wonderful pictures and you make everything look so cozy. I feel so lucky to have found your blog:)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You should make a trip to New England.  Maine and Vermont are both just beautiful.  I want us to make another trip there one fall to see all the leaves.  Thank you for all your sweet comments AND for reading the posts. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Love road trips!  Isn&#039;t it fun just to get out and about.  And you have had some rather spectacular ones this summer. Bar Harbor looks delightful.  Maine is on our bucket list along with Vermont for the fall.  Those homes and churches are just New England charming. But my favorite was the Coal Oil Company with the Mobil flying red horse. Awesome! And kitchen stores, I am a little envious there. I enjoyed the trip!

&lt;em&gt;You are right; we definitely had a spectacular one this summer.  That one won&#039;t be matched for quite a while....probably not until we make our next one to the west coast.  And even then, I don&#039;t believe we will find another kitchen store as large as the one we saw in Maine.  It was beautiful!
