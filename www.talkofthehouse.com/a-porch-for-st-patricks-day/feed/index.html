		<description><![CDATA[Kelly....I love all your ideas as you decorate for each &quot;season&quot; or event. I read your blog faithfully.
I too have a large screen porch that I love. Living in NC, (weather much similar to your Georgia)..does the humidity not bother your wood furniture? I love your little desk by the door, and your chairs at the table! I had a wood table on my porch last year, and some areas of the top started to &quot;warp&quot; a little. Give me some tricks to keep this from happening!

Thanks! You and your blog are an inspiration!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;The wood pieces on our porch are painted with a number of coats of polyurethane.  The end by the desk is well protected, and it does not get very damp at all.  Even when there is wind, it does not blow in there.  The dining table end does get wet on the floor and close to the screened wall.  The polyurethane seems to do a great job on the pieces near there.  I do go back and put a wax paste on both the wicker tabletop and the long dining table each year.  I use Johnson&#039;s paste wax and buff it well. (http://www.homedepot.com/p/SC-Johnson-1-lb-Fine-Wood-Paste-Wax-00203/100154748 )  That seems to do the trick for the pieces out there.
Hope this helps!
