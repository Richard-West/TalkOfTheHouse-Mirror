		<description><![CDATA[My favorite childhood toy was a doll named Baby Crawl Along . She actually crawled using the remote control on a wire connected to the doll&#039;s back . My grandparents gave her to me and I was overjoyed !
Thank for the grand finale of the tour . I loved the children&#039;s room with the tea party waiting for guests .]]></description>
