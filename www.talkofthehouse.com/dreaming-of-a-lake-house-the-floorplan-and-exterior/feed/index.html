		<description><![CDATA[Recognize that Hudson&#039;s Bay blanket! Love them!
----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Me too!  And have you seen the Pendleton National Parks things?  The ones for Glacier National Park look very much like the Hudson Bay stripes except they have black in place of the navy in the Hudson Bay ones.

		<description><![CDATA[Love your ideas; looking forward to seeing more. But, have you bought the teeny tiny lot you found on the lake?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your comments on all the posts Linda.  We have not purchased the lot.  In fact, it has been taken off the market, so we are still looking (but we can&#039;t put our house on the market until we get the exterior painted anyway.)  Still in the dreaming stage here. :)
