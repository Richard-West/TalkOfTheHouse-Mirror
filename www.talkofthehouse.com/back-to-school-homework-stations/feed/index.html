		<description><![CDATA[Hands down ... The painted child&#039;s table and two sweet chairs with the cute little red cushions tied on with ribbon is my favorite!!! I liked it so much that I had my husband paint our granddaughter&#039;s table and chairs white and then distress it a little. I am going to make red gingham cushions with ribbon ties for the chairs! Thanks for the inspiration .

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  I really like these homework stations. The first one is my favorite and I think it might be in your daughters room? My second favorite is the separated stations by toulmincabinetry.com. It would work nicely in any home and could even transition for work/office space for grown kids or adults. The mix of cabinetry, hard woods and counter tops is what draws me in.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, the first one IS our daughter&#039;s desk area.  So thank you Dawn!  I agree with you that the cabinetry one would be great for grown kids or adults.  I would certainly use it!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
