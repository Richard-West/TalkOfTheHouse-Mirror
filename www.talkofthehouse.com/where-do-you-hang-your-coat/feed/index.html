		<description><![CDATA[Hi I would like to know wear to  hang  the coats in my hall way ,
I usaully hang them up over the radiator 
And they are lovely and warm when iput them on .
But they look so untidy 
What do you rcommed .
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Barb, I think having them warmed before you put them on, outweighs the untidiness of the area. :)  Perhaps it is the number of coats you have there...maybe limit it to 2 or 3, and keep a basket close by for gloves, scarves, and other things. (And hung up the rest of the coats in a closet.)&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
