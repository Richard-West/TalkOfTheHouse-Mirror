		<description><![CDATA[That hot chocolate recipe sounds delicious. I just may have to whip up a batch. I love the gingham and pom pom trim combo! Your daughter must love her room-it&#039;s so festive!

		<description><![CDATA[Love the red room- it&#039;s so fresh all year long!!  Got to try this cocoa recipe!!
Maybe it will cool down  here in upstate South Carolina. 2 years ago we had a white Christmas Day.  Last year we had a summer Christmas in New Zealand-all about the beach and the barbie.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Pat P. ‚Äì So glad you liked the room. Both of my sons want to one day go to New Zealand. I was just reading tonight about someone in New Zealand closing their etsy shop after Christmas for ‚Äúsummer break.‚Äù That seems so strange to me! We are having record highs for December here in Georgia this week, so I know what you mean about it needing to cool down in South Carolina‚Ä¶just doesn‚Äôt seem like Christmas when you can wear shorts!
