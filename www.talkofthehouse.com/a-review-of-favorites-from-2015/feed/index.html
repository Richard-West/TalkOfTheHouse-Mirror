		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly!  Happy New Year!  I&#039;m late on commenting, but we were traveling to Scottsdale for Christmas (from VT).  I agree that picking ONE favorite is too hard, but I do want to say that your children&#039;s room/apartment makeovers were WONDERFUL.  I&#039;ve pinned your son&#039;s to my special board for my son&#039;s future apartment.  I wish we lived closer, because I just KNOW we&#039;d be friends! ;)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Good grief what a looooong trip you made Lisa!  Thank you for the compliments on the kids&#039; apartments. (And thank you for pinning the photos!)  Yes, I know we would be friends too if we were closer.  Vermont was just beautiful when we visited there this summer.  So perhaps I should mention moving there to my husband. LOL
Happy New Year!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

&lt;em&gt;No problem!  My fingers don&#039;t usually wake up for awhile in the morning to type correctly!
