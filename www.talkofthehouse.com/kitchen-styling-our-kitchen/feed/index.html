		<description><![CDATA[It is ME again!  As I stalk your archives I noticed the black gingham curtains in your kitchen.  I have cornice boards (do they still call them that?) covered with black gingham in my kitchen with gold mustardy (?) walls.  I didn&#039;t think alot about that choice when I made it. Now I realize that black gingham can go with ANY paint choice.  I had no idea I was so smart!  :)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Susan ‚Äì I have always loved gingham, and in the last few years put the black gingham most everywhere in the house. You are so right‚Ä¶it goes with practically everything..which allows me to redecorate as much as I want.): And yes, you are so smart!!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m bj and over here to steal ideas from YOU. :))
When I mentioned I was doing black and white photos of my kids and grandkids, Stacey at Poofing Pillows said I should come see your black and whites.
Well, right off the bat, now I want those little black and white kitchen curtains. Did you make them, order them, steal them somewhere?:)
Going to search thru and find more of your photos in b&#038;W ....
xo bj

&lt;em&gt;You are too funny BJ! Sorry, but I made the black and white curtains in the kitchen (and almost all of them in the house.) I do believe Country Curtains sells check panels in short sizes though. The check in their ‚ÄúCabin Check‚Äù is a little larger than mine. I have ordered those panels in the long lengths from them for the windows in my sons‚Äô room and then lined them when I get them to give them some added weight.
If you look through any of the photos of the house, you will see the black and white photographs. They are EVERYWHERE!
Thank you for reading here and leaving your sweet (and funny!) comments. And I need to thank Stacey for sending you my way. You folks are awesome!
