		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful sunny rooms and buildings! Can you believe in our neck of the woods the schools are on delay schedules due to ...SNOW?!
My husband, daughter, granddaughter and I just returned from 89 degree weather on a Disney cruise. All the females wore flip flops on the flight home and our toes turned blue walking to the car when we returned to Asheville. 
How exciting that Mercer beat Duke!!!! We were all happy when we realized that ESPN was on one of the channels in our room...all the other channels were Disney movies. With all the upsets I am thinking most people&#039;s brackets must look a mess! I do want to say &quot;Welcome to the Southern Conference!!!&quot; The SC tournament is in Asheville next March. We always go with good friends and stay the entire weekend. You should make plans to go. It is a lot of fun and you could visit the Biltmore House while you are in town.
Hope your spring break is soon and sunny!!!

&lt;em&gt;I can believe it.  I went to Asheville one spring break and got caught in 13 inches of snow one year!  Never again.  A Disney cruise!  We are all jealous!!! How very fun. :)  We will have to check our calendars for next year.  Our middle child is a huge basketball fan, so I know he would love it.
