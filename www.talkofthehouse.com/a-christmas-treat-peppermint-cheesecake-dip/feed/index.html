		<description><![CDATA[I love your website and have truly enjoyed all of your Christmas post. I want to know where you found your black and white plaid dinner napkins?

Thanks
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Cathi.  Those came from Sur La Table about a year ago.  I am hoping they bring their check napkins back for another season.  They currently have some buffalo check ones in red and blue on their site but no smaller scale black ones.
Hope this helps!

		<description><![CDATA[Everything is just darling.  Your pictures and ideas have inspired me to do a little something more in my kitchen.  I am loving it.  One question, what do you do with your Christmas Cards that you receive?  Merry Christmas to you and your family, BeBe
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;BeBe,
Thank you for your kind compliments!  In January, I tie up each year&#039;s Christmas cards with twine and the bundles come out again each Christmas.  I display them in a basket in the kitchen.  I have been doing this since 2010, so there were 6 bundles in there this year.  The current year&#039;s cards are loose in the front of the basket until the end of the Christmas season.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
