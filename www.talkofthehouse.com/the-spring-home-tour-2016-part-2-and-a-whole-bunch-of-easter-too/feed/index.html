		<description><![CDATA[Your decor is so lovely, Kelly.   The floral is so pretty &#038; fresh, and the black &#038; yellow are stunning!  Your parents&#039; azaleas took my breath away--one of the many things I love about visiting the south.  Here in Chicagoland, my daffodils &#038; sweet violets are blooming beauties.  We had so much fun watching our 4 grandsons delightedly open their baskets &#038;&#039;hunt for eggs, giggling the entire time....and the most unforgettable blessing of our Easter was a precious new granddaughter born at 5:07am!!  Her name is Hope.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f495.png" alt="ðŸ’•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

&lt;em&gt;That is just wonderful about your newest grandchild...and Hope is the perfect name for an Easter baby. :)  Belated congratulations to you and your family!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
