		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, it is O.K. to murder whatever you need to murder in in order to reuse it.  I murder vintage Reader&#039;s Digest Condensed books.  My dad and I cut them and turn them into letters for people to just sit around on book shelves or wherever they want to put them.  (Who would want to read the condensed version of a book anyway?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Better to murder the books than to murder plants like I do!  What a neat project you and your dad are making.  Great way to reuse the books! :)
