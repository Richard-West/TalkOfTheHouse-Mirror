		<description><![CDATA[Catching up on all your Disney posts.  The Wilderness Lodge would be the ticket for me.  How fun.  Disney World is just amazing, isn&#039;t it?  That food looked wonderful Kelly.  Thank goodness Disney involves a lot of walking.  It helps to work off the calories consumed!  :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You do walk off a lot of it, but not all - considering how much we ate!  I loved seeing Wilderness Lodge, but I do think I like the beachy ones better - especially if you go in the spring and summer.  If we made a winter trip though, I think Wilderness Lodge would be my choice then.  The Polynesian is also wonderful, but they were doing a ton of construction on it when we were there, so we avoided it.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing your fun vacation! The Wilderness Lodge is also reminiscent of the Yellowstone Lodge.

Too bad you couldn&#039;t eat at Artist Point. My husband and I went for our 20th anniversary in December. Artist Point was my favorite restaurant on that trip service and food-wise. The Smoky Portobello Mushroom Soup still sends me into reverie; they graciously provided me with the recipe. I also discovered black lava salt which topped the butter for the bread. (World Market sells it.)

We have also dined at California Grill 3 times; the food is always good, service is OK; always very busy.

We have never eaten at Boma but did enjoy the other one (Jika?) a few years ago.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I hope to get to dine at Artist Point on our next trip.  What a great place to celebrate your anniversary!  That soup sounds delicious, and I will have to look for the black lava salt the next time we are in World Market.  Thanks for the suggestion.  Our daughter dined with her boyfriend at Jiko on Sunday night.  She had a lamb dish that she said was absolutely delicious.
