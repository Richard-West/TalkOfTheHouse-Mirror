		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

Oh my yes... yellow has so many possibilities... I painted our front hall a lovely deep mustard yellow and the wall leading up the stairs is a deep terra cotta.  It sounds like it is way too bold but incredibly they really work! (The livingroom is a taupe with a tinge of green- I know!!  But it works... really!). When we get back from our next big sailing trip I&#039;m thinking I&#039;d like to paint our bedroom a lovely warm yellow just like the one from Blackberry Farm, yes I would!

Now what&#039;s all this about boiled peanuts?  Peanuts in the shell and you boil them?  Hmmmm... very curious!  We Canadians (at least those of us in Alberta) just shell the peanuts and either eat them raw unsalted or have them roasted and salted... but boiled?  My my my!  Perhaps I&#039;ll try them and start a trend up here!

Thanks, Kelly, for your great photos and ideas as usual...

&lt;em&gt;Cath – I don’t think that is too much color…sounds very warm and inviting to me! I can’t believe you have never heard of boiled peanuts. Oh my goodness! I knew they were southern, but I did not realize how southern they really are. You definitely need to try them, and you must eat them hot. They are not good cold to me. You still have to shell them, but they are so good warm and salty. Go ahead and start the trend!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I love certain shades of yellow.  I was recently inspired to incorporate yellow somewhere in my house by visiting my friend&#039;s house on Bainbridge Island in Washington.  The has a collection of confit pots that inspired her to incorporate more yellow into their house.  It&#039;s such a cheery color.  Keep us posted on foray into yellow.  I do love the clothing items you showed.

&lt;em&gt;Karen – Isn’t it funny what inspires us to do things?! How wonderful that you got to go to Bainbridge Island. When we took a trip out west a couple of years ago, we wanted to include Bainbridge Island in our itinerary, but it was just too far north to go. Lucky you! Glad you liked the clothing. I have GOT to do some clothing shopping sometime soon…hopefully this week. Thank you for adding your comments to the conversation here.
