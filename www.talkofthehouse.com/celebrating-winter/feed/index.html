&lt;em&gt;Isn&#039;t it a beautiful publication?!  I hope you have stayed nice and warm during this very cold week here in the south.  I bet you got a lot of snow!
Enjoy your weekend.

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it true that you always want what you can&#039;t have? Living in Ohio for my entire life, the snow is only nice when it gives us a white Christmas! Other than that, it&#039;s a royal pain to have to shovel or drive in and I too, only like to look at it from indoors or in magazines! Thank you Kelly for your wonderful and always inspirational blog :)
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That is so very true.  I imagine if we had snow all the time we would tire of it (but we would also be better equipped to handle it.)  A white Christmas is something I wish for every single year.  One year we are going to have it!
