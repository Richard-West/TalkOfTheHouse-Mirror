		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly - 

I love your decorations! All the touches of red are so warm and inviting. I love tulips and have them in vases on my mantle. They are starting to go, so I&#039;ll be replacing them soon. Maybe I&#039;ll go with the potted ones this time. I&#039;ll look at Trader Joe&#039;s next time I&#039;m there (thanks for the tip, Karen of Garden, Home and Party!) I like the idea of keeping my home stocked with my favorite flower!

I wish I had your talent for calligraphy, Kelly, - everything just looks adorable. I am so glad I found your blog. Reading it and looking at your decorations is like taking a mini-vacation to the cutest bed and breakfast ever!

Read your post about the valentines you give your student - so wish I had thought of that when I was still teaching! The last couple of years, I gave my students little playdough containers - I think they were made to give as Valentines, but i&#039;m not sure. I didn&#039;t want to give my students candy, either.(If those Hershey&#039;s Kisses were over my desk, they&#039;d be gone in about 2 days!)

XO,
Kelly]]></description>
