		<description><![CDATA[Love the colors inside and out . Our beach house has similar out door colors, but inside we couldn&#039;t decide to went with a creamy antique white , so I can easily change colors with curtains and accents.   Would love to know colors that were used on the interior !
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I think a creamy antique white is gorgeous on a beach house (and a mountain house as well!)  The paint used in Second Sandbar was probably a custom mix, but I bet Toby West could tell you.  If you do a search of his name at http://adac.designcentersearch.com/ you can find an email address to contact him through his company.
