		<description><![CDATA[LOVE the bead board, I always thought you had the house built with it. Hooray for handy husbands! although I love this area just as it is and The house of smiths home, they are so very different to me, made me wonder what your interpretation would look like. I imagine, more bead board and lots of wicker baskets! btw now I am dreaming of the small addition I&#039;ve always wanted but covered with bead board.. the natural wood is one of the details I love most about your home.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the bead board trick and the wood trim around the doors. my husband and I love rustic and looking through your house gave me some great ideas. been looking for ways to make a house more rustic with a cabin lodge feel.

&lt;em&gt;Dawn- Glad I could be of help! We love rustic too – almost bought a log home 17 years ago. (Thank goodness we didn’t since we later learned it had termites!)
