		<description><![CDATA[Forgot to mention,  I too loved that movie Somethings Gotta Give.  
September 2012 I FINALLY got to the Hamptons for a mini R&#038;R.  It was everything I ever dreamed it would be.  Of course, I wasn&#039;t invited into any of those fancy homes, darn.  LOL !!!   
DITTO with many of you,  if I ever win the NJ Lottery, ( play it faithfully),  I will hire Sawyer Berson as well. 
Once again, thank you for sharing and as someone else said, would love to share a glass of wine with you and chat about all these places.
