		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the party, and unfortunately Texas sun does not smile sweetly on the geraniums, but my home has been forms or red and green for about 40 years.....does that count???
Love your pictures and your home!
Thank you for your time and effort to create a lovely place to visit.
Blessings,

&lt;em&gt;Better late than never! :)  No the Texas heat would be quite brutal to geraniums.  Ours seem to do best when there is a little touch of coolness in the air.  I think the red and green in your home should definitely count! (Especially since it is one of my favorite combinations.) Thank you for your kind comment and for taking the time to read my posts.  I am so glad you enjoy them!

		<description><![CDATA[Everything looks lovely! So fresh and summery! I love the strawberry baskets on the plates! How creative! I have missed reading your blog. I&#039;ve been repainting the kids bathroom and the kitchen for the last 3 weeks! So glad that is over with. I&#039;ll be sharing it soon on my blog! Thought of you often while I was doing my kitchen. I just love the way you change it up every season and I kept thinking of how I can now change my up much easier. Thanks for all your inspiration!]]></description>
