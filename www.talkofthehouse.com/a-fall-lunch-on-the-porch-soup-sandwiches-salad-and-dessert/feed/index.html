		<description><![CDATA[Ok - I want to carbon copy this EXACT meal and not change a thing.  Delish!!!  Maybe this weekend :-)  I have the foolproof cookbook on my Christmas list too.

&lt;em&gt;It&#039;s a good one, and your boys would like it too.  The Foolproof book is full of great recipes.  Hope you get it for Christmas!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, just wanted to stop by with a greeting and catch up on this post that I somehow missed. I see where you are doing better with some new meds, let&#039;s hope you are on the right track because it is getting to be that busy time of year...! Glad the weather&#039;s been good, that does cheer the spirit. Loooove the pumpkin soup bowls, they are so sweet. You know, I (who bake all the time) never have great luck with blondies, I find they look perfect right out of the oven and then harden terribly before cutting. Yours look so yummy with the M and M&#039;s and ice cream, maybe the secret is using a glass pan? On a grilled cheese note: my friend had made a wonderful massaged kale salad and the next day put some of the leftover salad into her grilled cheese sandwiches, heavenly! So, I say, bring on the bacon and anything else you&#039;d like in that sandwich. Hope you have some fun weekend plans, eagerly awaiting your next post.

&lt;em&gt;Hi Paula!  The secret to blondies is undercooking them.  Take them out before they are done in the middle, and they will work great. Also, if they are too hard, you can always microwave them (on a plate of course - not your metal pan.:)) The salad in the grilled cheese sounds good- yes, sandwiches can take anything you want to throw in them for some zing.  And that bacon certainly added a nice punch of flavor to ours.  Our weekend is busy with trying to get our yard in shape...but at least the weather is beautiful for it.  Enjoy your weekend!
