		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Where did you find the little craft paper houses? Did you make them yourself? And which of Target&#039;s departments carries the banners? I enjoyed your post very, very much.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Monika, they came from Hobby Lobby, but I think I have seen them at Michaels as well.  They are on the aisle with the craftboard letters. (They are not expensive, and I lucked out and got them on a half price sale...making them around $2 each.) The banners were on the aisle at Target that has all the colorful paper plates, napkins, straws, ballons, etc.  The banner was on the side opposite of all the colorful party stuff.  Our Target has chalkboard paper and craft paper party items there.  I&#039;m happy you enjoyed the post!
