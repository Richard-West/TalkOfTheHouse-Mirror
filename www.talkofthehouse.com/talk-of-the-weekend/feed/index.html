		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly!  I live 3 minutes from Bare Bulb!  I love it that place!  Often, friends and I will go to Bare Bulb before or after a movie...so fun!  I love your blog!  It&#039;s so neat to read a &quot;hometown&quot; girl blog.  I&#039;ll be heading to Wal Mart to get some of that ice cream tomorrow!  Have a very happy 4th of July!  We will be heading to Tybee!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Don&#039;t you just love Bare Bulb, and have you tried the gelato???!  I hope you have had a fun time at Tybee.  The weather should have been just perfect for you!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hello! I&#039;m one of the authors involved in the book giveaway (that&#039;s my &#039;baby,&#039; &quot;Rescue Me, Maybe,&quot; in the photo) and just wanted to say thank you for including the link to our giveaway! 

The main character in the book I&#039;m currently working on is an interior designer, and &quot;she&quot; loves that kitchen photo you posted! I can see I&#039;m going to need to poke around your site! 

Thanks again,
Jackie

&lt;em&gt;Hi Jackie!  You are quite welcome for the link to the giveaway.  I think anyone who loves pets would enjoy your book. :)  If the main character in your new book is into design, I&#039;m certain I would like it! Thanks for visiting the blog!
