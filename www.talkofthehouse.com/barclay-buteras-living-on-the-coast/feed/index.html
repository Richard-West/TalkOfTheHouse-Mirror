		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve followed him for a while and just love his stuff.  I&#039;m a red, white and blue kind of decorator and I love wicker and rattan with the coastal influence.  I love how he uses upscale rattan furniture and sailing paintings and mixes them with fresh fabrics.  And he&#039;s not afraid to use floral chintz but he does it different than all that chintz that was overused in the 80s and 90s.  His style is reminiscent of some of Ralph Lauren&#039;s work.]]></description>
