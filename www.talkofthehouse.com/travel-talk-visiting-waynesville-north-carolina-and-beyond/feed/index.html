		<description><![CDATA[I just love your travel posts Kell.So well written with great photos. I always enjoy curling up with a coffee whilst reading them. I end up feeling I&#039;ve been on a trip with you ....and we always go to such lovely places :)
Have a great weekend ...I&#039;m away with my daughter, niece (we&#039;re more like sisters,close in age) and her daughters. Looking forward to lots of walks on the beach and late night/early morning chats :) Happy times!
