		<description><![CDATA[Woops! Just remembered I was supposed to be commenting on St. Simon&#039;s-  I had a lovely visit to this lovely place years ago with my Junior Year in Paris roommate and her Southern family  and we stayed at  a marvelous hotel/resort  called The Cloister.  I remember the beautiful wide and deserted beaches and the singular beauty of the wild horses we caught a fleeting glimpse of on Cumberland Island.  The island I remember didn&#039;t have much development at the time so while the houses you show are very nice, some are perhaps too large and too much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bonjour,Kelly!
Thank you for your lovely posts. Thought I&#039;d let you know how Idiscovered your blog;it was during my explorations 0nline to research a visit to Savannah and Tybee Island. Your visuals of the Mermaid Cottages with their mouth-watering colours and decor- well, it was like trying to choose from a box of Laduree macarons!

My Westie, Thistle, was smitten with the charming dogs on the book covers.  She thought they looked very sympathique.

A bientot!
