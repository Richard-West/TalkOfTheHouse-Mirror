		<description><![CDATA[I love the black and lime together.  Fabulous!  And those chunky glass containers to hold ugly game controllers are delightful.  Great idea.

&lt;em&gt;Christina – I think jars can elevate the status of practically anything – even those ugly game controllers. (And Lord knows there are a zillion of them around here!)

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Your buffet being painted is just like the &quot;I Did It&quot; story on the last page of Better Homes and Gardens that came in the mail last night.  This gal couldn&#039;t part with her grandmother&#039;s buffet, but it wasn&#039;t meeting the family&#039;s needs in it&#039;s original state....sooo, her husband built a hutch and cupboards around it and made it all into one big unit of built-ins and painted it all a gray-green.  Now she can enjoy the buffet in a way that meets their needs for today!  Great job on recycling your beloved buffet for a new purpose!  Love it!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Michelle – We obviously have the same taste! I saw that feature and LOVED it – both for the piece of furniture AND for the green – and the story too. I have been looking and looking for a photo of it on the bhg site so that I can pin it to my “green” board since I liked it so much. So far, I have not been able to find it. Please let me know if you see it online. (I don’t want to scan it and pin it…just doesn’t seem “legal” to me.) Thank you for your comments here today!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
