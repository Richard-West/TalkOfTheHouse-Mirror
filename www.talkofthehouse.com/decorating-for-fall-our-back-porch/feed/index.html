		<description><![CDATA[Kelly!
I just found your blog and am in love with your porch!  Your new cabinet is gorgeous and, in my opinion, does not need glass doors......all your pretty pottery shows so nicely the way it is now!

I am off to explore more of your beautiful blog! &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;!!!

&lt;em&gt;Georgia ‚Äì Thank you so much for the compliments on the porch! Everyone else has agreed with you that no doors are needed on that cabinet, and my husband thanks all of you. Ha ha! I hope you find more that you like as your explore older posts. It is so nice to meet you too.

		<description><![CDATA[I just love the way you decorate Kelly! I just stumbled upon your blog, and got some amazing inspiration. Your home is beautiful! I love the outside paint colors also. Would you be willing to share the names if those? Thanks so much!  Misty
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Misty ‚Äì You are too sweet, girl! I am glad your ‚Äústumbling‚Äù led you to my blog. :) Our exterior is painted with a Martin Seynour paint ‚Äì Pelham Gray. It really is a paint and not a stain, and I am not sure why they call it gray. It is more of a khaki tan-greenish-gray (real precise!) If I remember correctly, it is in the Williamsburg line of paints, but that could be wrong. We started out with an opaque stain the first time we painted the house but went with a paint this time. All of the trim is painted with a Benjamin Moore high gloss paint called Brilliant white. It is a real white white. I even used it on the kitchen cabinets! The dark ceiling of the porches is a Lowe‚Äôs Valspar paint called Lyndhurst Timber.
Enjoy your Sunday!
