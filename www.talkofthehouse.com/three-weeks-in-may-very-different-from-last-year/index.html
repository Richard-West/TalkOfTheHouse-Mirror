Since you have come to this place I'm guessing you probably like to do the same.  Look around here a bit, and you will find rooms and houses, ideas for entertaining, places to visit, and other randomness that my brain likes to think about.  If you have a question about <em>anything</em>, please leave a comment.  I would love to talk with you!</li>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://miriadna.com/preview/face-off-to-rain" target="_blank"><em><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/field-at-sunset-1024x691(pp_w717_h483).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9974" width="717" height="483" alt="" /></em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On this date last year I wrote a &#8220;non-house&#8221; post to record all the fun events and accomplishments of our children that had occurred during those <a title="Three Weeks in May" href="../index.html%3Fp=1262.html" target="_blank">three weeks in May</a>.  It was very celebratory in nature.  But these three weeks in May have been entirely different this year.  I have been very hesitant to write all of this, but I want to let you know why you haven&#8217;t seen any photos of our house lately on the blog.  The house has been at the bottom of the list this month to say the least.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://miriadna.com/preview/face-off-to-rain" target="_blank"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/rain-1024x682(pp_w755_h502).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9971" width="755" height="502" alt="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You know the old saying, &#8220;When it rains, it pours.&#8221;  Well it has sort of felt like that lately.  It all started three weeks ago on a Tuesday night.  Our dog Cooper had an electronic fence and collar which kept him in our yard for many many years.  In fact, if you took his collar off him, he would still stay there in the yard.  <em>But</em> he had run out of the yard the previous day.  So the battery in his collar was replaced.  Apparently on that particular Tuesday night, the batteries failed or he did not care about the consequences.  Whatever the reason, he must have tracked something (as beagles are known to do) into the road in front of our house, and he was hit by a car in the middle of the night.  Cooper had been our daughter&#8217;s dog.  At the time, my daughter was away on a trip to Disney World.  So we made a decision to wait to tell her about the loss of her dog until she got home that Friday.  And among the first words out of that girl&#8217;s mouth as she was getting out of the car was, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Cooper?”</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Late that same Friday night, she received a text from a friend stating, &#8220;I am riding with my mother to the hospital.  We think she has had a stroke.&#8221;  When my daughter told me, I thought she meant her friend was <em>driving</em> her mom &#8211; which was crazy.  I later learned she meant she was riding with her in the ambulance.  She talked with my daughter several times through the night with updates.  Things went from bad to worse. By early Saturday, we learned that the doctors did not think she was going to make it.  That was the day before Mother&#8217;s Day.  We spent part of Sunday (Mother&#8217;s Day) at the hospital with my daughter&#8217;s friend.   Her mother died late in the afternoon that day&#8230; yes, Mother&#8217;s Day.  I should also add that this same young lady lost her father to cancer just 3 years ago.  It is enough to break your heart for her, but this 19 year old has handled everything with such grace; it would put many adults to shame.  The mother was an organ donor.  So out of this sadness, some others received life changing gifts.</p>

<p>I will tell you about the funeral in a few minutes, but I want to fast forward to Friday of that following week.  That was when my husband and both our sons left for a canoe camping trip in North Georgia.  There was a slight 20% chance of rain for the weekend according to the weather report they had read.  They got to the river kind of late on Friday evening but had no trouble setting up camp, and they spent Saturday canoeing down to their next camping place.  Around 10:00 that night my husband called to ask about the weather since he was seeing lightning in the distance.  I checked the radar, and it looked like an isolated storm moving through south of where I thought they were camping.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/campsite-1024x727(pp_w755_h536).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9976" width="755" height="536" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But it rained through the night and on into Sunday morning.  And these were no ordinary rains – these were news making rains. The water level rose fast and high.  They had no choice but to pack up and canoe out of there in the rain – and they had the worst of the rapids to go through that day.  My husband and oldest son were in one canoe loaded down with a good bit of the camping gear tied in buckets, and our other son was soloing in another canoe with the rest of the supplies a few minutes behind them. My husband tells me he really thought they had made it through those rapids as they hit them, but it was the large wave at the bottom that hit the boat and made them turn over.  They were all wearing life jackets. My husband managed to grab hold of the upside down 17 ft. canoe with all the tied on buckets, and he went down the river with it. This was the Toccoa, and there were no “pull over” places in that particular part of the river, plus the water was flowing so fast he could do nothing to stop.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/river-on-saturday-1024x768(pp_w755_h566).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9978" width="755" height="566" alt="" /><em>River on day 1.  It rose almost 2 feet during the night and next day.</em></p>
<p>He finally made it over to the shore.  Our middle son came down the river, but he too could not stop due to the racing speed of the quickly rising river.  My husband yelled to him to find his brother.  A little further downstream he did find him, but again there was no way for him to stop his canoe.  He yelled back to his father through the rain that he had found him.</p>
<p>According to our oldest son, when he was flipped out of the boat his ankle got trapped between some rocks…and he was underwater.  The only way to break free was to literally twist his leg in a way to break it.  It was that or drown.  He chose the first option.  He broke free and continued to go down the river for another 10 minutes before he could get over to the shore.   My husband then had the challenging job of getting our son with the fractured ankle out of the river, get the canoe out of the river, pack it again, get our son in it, and paddle the rest of the way.  Add to that, they were both freezing cold from being in that mountain water that long. My husband had lost his paddle when he was getting out on shore.   Luckily, our son with the fractured ankle had managed to hold on to his paddle through it all.</p>
<p><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bridge-768x1024(pp_w755_h1006).jpg" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9979" width="755" height="1006" alt="" /></p>
<p>No middle child in sight.  They did not meet up with him for another hour (a scary thought in itself since he was soloing.)  He told me he did pull over downstream and wait for them for a long time, but since they never went past he thought they needed help.  He decided he would go on down the river; get the car, and then drive back to see if he could help them.  They did meet up again later, but my husband had to stop again because in the roughness of the waves, they kept taking on water, and he wanted to bail it out.  Our middle son then went on to finish the run ahead of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fracture-1024x683(pp_w717_h478).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9983" width="717" height="478" alt="" /></p>
<p> A fractured ankle means 10 days of wearing a “splint” until the swelling goes down enough to put on the cast.  Then it means 2 months of wearing the cast followed by physical therapy.  My son is not a happy camper (play on words intended here. 🙂 ) You see, this son quit his computer job in Atlanta a few weeks ago and moved back home in order to travel and then go back to college for a different degree.  In fact, he had plans to go to Seattle for a tournament and some hiking in the area in early July…not gonna happen.  He was working on getting his passport and making plans to go to Europe.  I do believe God has some different plans in mind for him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/school-1024x682(pp_w755_h502).jpg" class="aligncenter  wp-image-9984" width="755" height="502" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fast forward to last Friday.  I have been teaching for 31 years, and I have had a homeroom and my own room full of students for each of those years.  There have been a number of changes in education in our county in the last year, and because of this I decided I wanted/needed to change positions, if I was going to stay in the field.  So beginning next year I will be a full time math teacher who travels around our school to all grades working with students who struggle with math.  This is a job I had to <em>beg</em> to have.  My administration was not real happy to take me out of the regular classroom, but I think this is going to allow me to help students and have time to help teachers…a good thing.  So last Friday morning as I was getting ready for my emotional last day of having my own group of students and being a part of my wonderful third grade team, the phone rang.  It was my father telling me that his brother had passed away.  This was his last surviving sibling, and my uncle had been ill for a while.  So on this Memorial Day weekend we spent Sunday with relatives at a funeral in Alabama.</p>
<p><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/driveway-2.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9995" width="640" height="408" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now I want to tell you about the funeral for the mother of the young lady I mentioned earlier in this eternally long post.  (If you have read this far, I am proud of you! 🙂 ) Her mother worked in a kindergarten classroom in one of our primary schools.  She was <em>always</em> laughing, and she could talk your ear off!  So there was much laughter at the service as funny stories were told.  And there were several hard-to-hold-back-the-tears parts, too.  They read letters from her stepson, letters from her daughter, and cards from the young students in her class.  A group of teachers and staff from her school walked together down the aisle of the church, and each laid a white rose on the altar in her memory.  My daughter sang a solo.   I had told her, “Absolutely no eye contact.  Look at your music or the ceiling.”  She managed to hold it together until about the last couple of lines when she did make eye contact with someone.   The song she sang is called <i>Blessings</i>.   Here is a video of songwriter, Laura Story performing it.  It is such a beautiful song with lyrics full of hope and encouragement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGmKC34UZ68" target="_blank"><img src="../wp-content/themes/prophoto4/images/blank.gif" data-lazyload-src="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Laura-Story-performing-Blessings.png" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9986" width="638" height="387" alt="" /></a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGmKC34UZ68" target="_blank"><em>youtube.com</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So these three weeks in May have been <em>quite</em> the opposite of the same three weeks last year.  But we are so blessed in many ways…blessed to be able to help someone who has lost both of her parents, blessed that a fractured ankle was the only injury in a rapidly rising river, blessed to have a job that provides an income to help meet the needs of my family, and blessed to have family members who care about one another. I fully believe that good things can come out of sadness.  I also know that there is so much tragedy in this world that our problems often pale in comparison.  I cannot even begin to imagine the sadness and challenges that face the people of Moore, Oklahoma.  But I am so proud to be a part of a profession that had heroes amidst the disaster, and who are heroes to students daily.</p>

<p>Now you see why the house has not exactly been a top priority these last few weeks. 🙂 I have two more contract days to work at school to wrap up the year, and I plan to work the rest of the week moving all my things from my classroom to my new space &#8211; a task that is a mere drop in the bucket compared to what the teachers in Moore have to do to have a classroom for next year.  It will officially be summer break for me beginning next Saturday.  Hallelujah!!  I will be sharing a couple more “pretty houses” this week, and then the blog will hopefully get back to including things around here…and I have another giveaway for you coming soon. 🙂  Thank you so very much for reading this novel of a post, and for allowing me to share it all with you.  I count you as one of my blessings, too!</p>

		<p>Kelly, thank you for your transparency and sharing the trials and tribulations your family has been through the last month. I bet you&#8217;ve felt like Job at times, huh?  I love the song you shared (&#8220;Blessings&#8221;). I&#8217;m thankful His mercies are new every morning. YOU are a blessing to your friends, family and readers!  I&#8217;ll pray for some happier days ahead.<br />
P.S. I just returned from Gulf Shores, AL (not too far from Seaside &#8211; I love it there) so I really enjoyed your post about Seaside!<br />
Enjoy your summer!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m just now getting by to visit, since arriving back home. So, so sorry to hear all of this bad news. Losing a pet is so traumatic and losing a friend and family member, even more. But how wonderful that your family was spared what could have been a devastating outcome. I know your son isn&#8217;t thrilled with his break, but God can use this for His glory.</p>
<p>Hugs across the miles.</p>

		<p>I am still playing catch up from being gone.  I read every word.  It makes me think of that adage-when it rains when it pours- and that is certain applicable to your family&#8217;s situation.  God bless you- I wonder sometimes how we make it through the things we do.  At least no one was seriously injured in your immediate family.</p>
<p>My heart aches for your daughter&#8217;s friend and also for your dad losing his last sibling. What heartache.</p>
<p>Hang in there- when we are so far down I believe we need to lean together and look UP.  I think that is just what your family has done- Blessings- xo Diana</p>

		<p>So, so sorry for all your family and friends have endured this May.  If you will reread Leila Jane, Pat , and Tricia&#8217;s comments, they have said exactly what I think and feel.  (I couldn&#8217;t write it any better.)  Also, reread Katrina&#8217;s comments. Love her, she is the one who told me about your blog.  And, I agree with the girl who said that you don&#8217;t even look 31.  Finally, I think you should polish your son&#8217;s toenails a bright, happy color&#8230;while he is asleep.  Only 3 more days of May!</p>

		<p>Kelly, wow, you and your family have had a valley to walk through! I do believe it is in those moments that we grow as people and in our faith the most.  So sad about your daughter&#8217;s furry friend, her friend&#8217;s mother, and the trip.  Just from looking at your classroom, I can tell you poured your heart into being a teacher.  God obviously has something new for you to do.  Whenever something new has come my way that I have been unsure about, I have read this scripture. Isaiah 43:19  &#8220;See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.&#8221;  Sending lots of hugs through these keys 🙂</p>

		<p>Kelly,<br />
Oh my.  I was so sad by news of your daughter&#8217;s dog and of her friend&#8217;s mom passing away.  {Such a pretty song, I&#8217;m sure your daughter did a wonderful job singing it and it probably made her friend feel such love}.  That was a very scary story about your son&#8217;s and husband.  I&#8217;m relieved that they are home safe.  I hope your son&#8217;s ankle heals quickly and he can salvage some of the summer. You are right about the difference between your May of 2012 and now.  But your new position sounds like it will be so rewarding and fulfilling.<br />
Here&#8217;s to those clouds that have been lingering blowing away (we&#8217;ve all experienced stuff like this) and to sunny skies and happier days, my blog friend.<br />

		<p>Kelly, We just got home this afternoon from a camping trip on the Toccoa River. We took a raft down the river Sat and Sunday and I was leary because of all the rain. Thank goodness everything went ok. If I had read your post first I wouldn&#8217;t have gone I&#8217;m sure. I am so relieved to know that your family is ok and I thank the good Lord for it. I hope your daughter will continue to heal over her loss and her friend over the loss of her dear Mother. We all have so , so much to be thankful for and when you hear of someones sadness and all the tragedy around us it makes me count my blessings. Hoping you will get some rest during the summer and can enjoy your time with your family.<br />

		<p>Kelly, so very sorry to hear of all the things your family had to face those three weeks I am sure you were wondering when will this end. My heart goes out to your daughters friend. So young to loose both parents. When we lost our son 25 years ago I thought I would never be able to go on. You never get over it but with Gods grace and the love of family and friends you manage to survive. I feel that all the trials we must face in life makes us stronger. You all are in my thoughts and prayers. Yarlette</p>

I read your entire post and listened to the song &#8220;Blessings&#8221; and felt such sadness for you and your family.  We have all had those terrible weeks where the world seems to fall apart, and I have too.  I just always try to think God has other plans for us and if one good thing comes of any of this it will be a &#8220;Blessing&#8221;.<br />
I am a director of a diagnostic imaging department and have worked in x-ray for 40 years&#8230;tell your son the worst part is not moving around but it will get better maybe after his cast is on he could get a scooter for under his leg&#8230;..then he could really drive you nuts!<br />
God Bless and have a &#8220;quiet&#8221; day!<br />

		<p>Oh Kelly&#8230;it does seem that some times trials come one after the other. I will be praying for you!! Thanks for sharing transparently with your readers. I know it takes courage to share the bad times as well as the good times.  My heart goes out to the young woman who lost her mom on Mother&#8217;s Day.  I will be praying for her as well. And I am so glad that your men are alive and well. Blessings on your sweet family in the days to come.</p>

		<p>Wow.  So much has happened in the last 3 weeks!  Will keep you and your family in prayer as you continue to process everything, to grieve, and to adjust to new plans.  I&#8217;m thankful that your son is OK and that your family has been able to encourage and love on your daughter&#8217;s friend.</p>

		<p>Wow, Kelly I say it always happens in threes. So sorry about your daughter&#8217;s sweet beagle and her friend&#8217;s mother. So glad your husband and sons are okay. That night the weather was awful here, too and I did not sleep at all. I have never seen lightening that never stops. There was flooding and trees down around here, but nothing bad at our house. My husband slept through all of it while I kept looking at my ipad to see if we needed to take cover, but nothing wasn&#8217;t any warnings yet the weather was so awful.<br />
So sorry your son&#8217;s summer plans are messed up, but thank God he is alive!</p>

		<p>Kelly, It has been quite an eventful 3 weeks for your family and at the end of your post it was good to read that you find the glass 1/2 full. Your post truly gave me goose bumps reading about everything but especially about the camping trip, how frightening for them. Glad that it all came out fine even with the ankle and freezing bodies. Hug them tightly. And lastly, your daughter, I can only imagine how she must have felt, or how all of you felt, my pups are like our children and I can&#8217;t imagine when we don&#8217;t have them any longer. I can only tell you how sorry I am that your family has went through so much here lately. </p>
<p>I want to end this long comment with saying, &#8220;Congratulations&#8221; to you on your new position and I hope that it goes very well for you.</p>

		<p>Boy, all that with in days?  I am sure you are wondering what God has in store for everyone.  I cannot imagine being 19 and having both parents gone. I was in my late 40&#8217;s when my mother died, and I still need her, think of her and wonder why when she had so much to give. </p>
<p>What a scary river story! I would have been in a panic if an hour had gone by and I hadn&#8217;t heard from my other son! Your family is so brave. I am thankful that everyone is here! Your poor guy with the fractured ankle. I guess there is something really special for him since all of his plans have been changed! </p>
<p>Math was my worst subject! I hope you are able to change those little minds into believing math is their friend! It certainly wasn&#8217;t mine, and I still struggle! =)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry about your beagle. Our beagle has been gone for several years. They are such sweet dogs and head strong too!</p>
<p>I hope your summer break will be filled with happier times!</p>

		<p>My heart goes out to your daughter. My daughter had a beagle that she got when she was six( instead of the baby sister she wanted) and Daisy was her faithful companion for years. Daisy got very sick and we had to put her down the week of exams during my daughters first semester in collage.We cried the whole month of Dec.<br />
It always amazes me how quickly our lives can change.I am thankful you are able to see God&#8217;s love and purpose during your son&#8217;s accident and death of the friend&#8217;s mother.I am also so thankful your husband and sons are safe. My brother and his son were at the Boston Marathon (my nephew ran in it) and we knew my nephew had finished and that they were staying near the finish line to cheer folks on. When the bombs went off they were just a block away, but because the cell phone were cut off it was a while before we knew they were fine. Those times of uncertainty are scary.<br />
I hope your new job will be wonderful, I admire you for deciding to change things up&#8230;.I tend to want things to stay the same&#8230;.but this sounds like something you will love.<br />
I hope June is a nice quiet&#8230;..happy&#8230;.restful month.<br />
Thanks for sharing you life with us. The houses are lovely, but it is nice to get to know you!</p>

<p>My cousin lost her mother at a very early age and then lost her father when she was only 18 but she is a very strong woman now.  So yes God  does have his own plans for us.  And your daughters friend sounds like a strong young woman and is very lucky to have friends like you and your daughter!</p>
<p>Take care and my hope for you is to have a wonderful summer break.</p>

		<p>Oh Kelly, I know you had to wonder when would this all stop.  The loss of your dog had me crying, since I am such a dog lover.  And, God Bless that your boys and husband are safe and sound after that scarey campling trip.  I am sure you are feeling grateful that your son only had a fractured ankle. That will heal.  The young lady that lost her mother is so blessed to have your daughter as a special friend. You are so right about the changes in education; I know the teachers and children that you will be working with in math will be richly blessed to have you in their classrooms.  Packing up a classroom after thirty years is going to feel like moving.  I, like you, think nothing compares to the grief and loss in Oklahoma. As an educator, I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of the teachers that put their lives on the line to save their students. It has made me reflect and rethink the emergency procedures for our own school. Thank you for your post today, as always, you wrote with such feeling, compassion, and faith. No one reading your latest post could finish without being touched by each event.  God Bless you and your family. Have a safe and restful summer, I look forward to seeing more beach houses and can&#8217;t wait to see the finished room upstairs. Until next time&#8230;..</p>

		<p>Omigosh, crying now, Kelly.  I&#8217;m so very, very sorry about your daughter&#8217;s friend&#8217;s mother.  And I&#8217;m sorry about your daughter&#8217;s adorable beagle.  And I&#8217;m sorry your son broke his ankle&#8230;yet breathing a sign of relief he survived such an incredible mishap.  Even with all of this, I know you must also be feeling a sense of loss of leaving the traditional classroom of students.  Wow!  Thank you for sharing these things with all of us, though.  It makes me feel closer to your life as a person and not just see you as a one dimensional figure, &#8220;a girl with a beautiful house&#8221;.  I love your house with all of its beauty and ideas &#8211; don&#8217;t get me wrong!  I would return again and again to see your pictures and your ideas.  It&#8217;s just that you&#8217;ve shared some personal things from your life with us, so now you&#8217;re much more &#8220;real&#8221;.  I feel privileged and honored that you trusted your readers to share these things with.  Thank you and I&#8217;m sorry for all the recent pain and loss and finally, God bless you and your family.</p>

By early Saturday, we learned that the doctors did not think she was going to make it. \u00a0That was the day before Mother&#8217;s Day. \u00a0We spent part of Sunday (Mother&#8217;s Day) at the hospital with my daughter&#8217;s friend. \u00a0 Her mother died late in the afternoon that day&#8230; yes, Mother&#8217;s Day.\u00a0 I should also add that this same young lady lost her father to cancer just 3 years ago. \u00a0It is enough to break your heart for her, but this 19 year old has handled everything with such grace; it would put many adults to shame.\u00a0 The mother was an organ donor.\u00a0 So out of this sadness, some others received life changing gifts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9966\" src=\"http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/daisies-in-the-rain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"881\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/daisies-in-the-rain.png 881w, http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/daisies-in-the-rain-300x216.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 881px) 100vw, 881px\" \/><a href="http://www.talkofthehouse.com/three-weeks-in-may-very-different-from-last-year/\&quot;http:\/\/miriadna.com\/preview\/face-off-to-rain\&quot;" target=\"_blank\"><em>source<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I will tell you about the funeral in a few minutes, but I want to fast forward to Friday of that following week.\u00a0 That was when my husband and both our sons left for a canoe camping trip in North Georgia.\u00a0 There was a slight 20% chance of rain for the weekend according to the weather report they had read.\u00a0 They got to the river kind of late on Friday evening but had no trouble setting up camp, and they spent Saturday canoeing down to their next camping place.\u00a0 Around 10:00 that night my husband called to ask about the weather since he was seeing lightning in the distance.\u00a0 I checked the radar, and it looked like an isolated storm moving through south of where I thought they were camping.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9976\" src=\"http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/campsite-1024x727.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/campsite-1024x727.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/campsite-300x213.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But it rained through the night and on into Sunday morning. \u00a0And these were no ordinary rains \u2013 these were news making rains. The water level rose fast and high.\u00a0 They had no choice but to pack up and canoe out of there in the rain \u2013 and they had the worst of the rapids to go through that day.\u00a0 My husband and oldest son were in one canoe loaded down with a good bit of the camping gear tied in buckets, and our other son was soloing in another canoe with the rest of the supplies a few minutes behind them. My husband tells me he really thought they had made it through those rapids as they hit them, but it was the large wave at the bottom that hit the boat and made them turn over.\u00a0 They were all wearing life jackets. My husband managed to grab hold of the upside down 17 ft. canoe with all the tied on buckets, and he went down the river with it. This was the Toccoa, and there were no \u201cpull over\u201d places in that particular part of the river, plus the water was flowing so fast he could do nothing to stop.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9978\" src=\"http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/river-on-saturday-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/river-on-saturday-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.talkofthehouse.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/river-on-saturday-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><em>River on day 1. \u00a0It rose almost 2 feet during the night and next day.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>He finally made it over to the shore. \u00a0Our middle son came down the river, but he too could not stop due to the racing speed of the quickly rising river.\u00a0 My husband yelled to him to find his brother. \u00a0A little further downstream he did find him, but again there was no way for him to stop his canoe.\u00a0 He yelled back to his father through the rain that he had found him.<\/p>\n<p>According to our oldest son, when he was flipped out of the boat his ankle got trapped between some rocks\u2026and he was underwater.\u00a0 The only way to break free was to literally twist his leg in a way to break it.\u00a0 It was that or drown.\u00a0 He chose the first option.\u00a0 He broke free and continued to go down the river for another 10 minutes before he could get over to the shore.\u00a0\u00a0 My husband then had the challenging job of getting our son with the fractured ankle out of the river, get the canoe out of the river, pack it again, get our son in it, and paddle the rest of the way.\u00a0 Add to that, they were both freezing cold from being in that mountain water that long.
