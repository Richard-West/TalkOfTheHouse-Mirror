		<description><![CDATA[I knew you would love that house!! Truth be told, I loved it before it was redone. They had the most incredible estate sale there before the remodel. The husband had been and engineer and collector of MANY things (stamps, coins...), so all of his things we very organized and neat. The wife had an ENTIRE bedroom that was FULL of linens. It was wonderful. I really just went to the estate sale to look inside the house because I&#039;m weird like that (but I know you understand). It originally had one of those little hidden bars in the family room. I&#039;ve always thought those were so cool. The s&#039;mores recipes are to. Die. For. I can&#039;t decide which one to try first!!! I&#039;m planning some big cooking for football Saturday, so maybe one of these will fit the bill. I will admit here that I don&#039;t really care about football. I just like making pretty food! Have a great holiday weekend!! Missy

&lt;em&gt;Oh we are definitely sisters separated at birth!  Yes...you should go to estate sales just to see the rooms in the house. :)  Yes, you should make pretty food for football games and not care one bit about the game! ha ha. Hope all your food turned out delicious!

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Kelly, my mouth is watering for a smore.  The popcorn looks scrumptious and the rice krispie bars appeal to me.  But all of the recipes look noteworthy.  Thanks for this.

&lt;em&gt;All that chocolate makes me hungry too!  You should make those rice krispie treats.  I bet they are good.  Of course an original s&#039;more tastes pretty darn good too!
