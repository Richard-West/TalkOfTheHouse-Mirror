		<description><![CDATA[You had an awesome trip, Kelly. Are you happy to be back at home now? I know you enjoyed being with your son, as well. We actually start back to school later than usual this year. Kids don&#039;t come until August 29th! That hasn&#039;t been the case for many, many years!]]></description>
