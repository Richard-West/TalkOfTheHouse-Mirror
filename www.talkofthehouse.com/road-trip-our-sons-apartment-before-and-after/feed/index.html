		<description><![CDATA[Well done Kelly!!!  I have to admit, I am not sure I would have even known where to begin with the space.  Making it function well FOR EVERYTHING was not easy I know.  It looks SO AWESOME!  I love the color choices.....and his comments about his place being functional NOT DECORATED cracks me up!!!  Sounds like my son!  But I know when he takes a look at his place he JUST HAS to thrilled his mama helped because it looks trendy and amazing!  Hugs to you!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;We had to start with &quot;function&quot; first because with a space that small, every single item really counts.  We knew a desk and bed of some sort had to be the first items chosen.  We started looking online for those items before we even left.  I really wish I had had photos to see it before we got there...and window measurements.  I could have made a window treatment for him, and we could have chosen furniture from colors in that. Oh well, it all worked out in the end.  Thank you so very much for the compliments on the room!  It was a lot of work, but well worth it. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my you trained your son well.  My son&#039;s apartment looked like  the recycling bin met the dump when he was in college.  He will make some lovely lady a great husband!! And she will love you for training him so well!  Mind did come around by the way...just not so quickly...hats off to you!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh..our son is not trained well.  He would never ever make up a bed if allowed to live that way.  His argument is you are going to have to un-make it to sleep in it at night, so why bother?  I think being able to pick out his pieces with a color scheme in mind helped to make it all work.  Glad to know your son &quot;came around.&quot;  I think living in an organized and clean environment actually makes you accomplish more...makes it easier to find things more quickly.  Maybe our son will come around to that line of thinking one day. :)
