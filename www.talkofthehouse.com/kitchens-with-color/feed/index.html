		<description><![CDATA[Another set of beautiful kitchens! I think it is so cute that you are a decorator &quot;groupie&quot;-I don&#039;t even notice who the decorators are in the photos I like. Now I will be more aware.

I personally think the white ones from the other day are more appealing, but I can find lots I like in each of your pics. 

Partial to Seaside! Do you suppose they really cook when they are down there?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;A decorator groupie! That’s so funny Susan!! I am still partial to the white ones myself because I like the lightness of them – plus they work so well with any other color. You know I looooove Seaside too. When we are there, we DO cook some (can’t afford to eat out every meal with all our kids!) I would think if you actually lived there, you would use your kitchen on a regular basis. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live there?
