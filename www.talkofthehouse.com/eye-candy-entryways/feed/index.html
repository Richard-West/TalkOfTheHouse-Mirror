		<description><![CDATA[I love the enormous one and also that one with red closet doors, hats and that old chest in between. 
I gotta quit dreaming though...not ever moving or building again! 
What us dreamers could do though is stay in places like this, I guess when traveling some day all rich and stuff ;)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Arenâ€™t those red doors wonderful, Phyllis? I am so tempted to do that since I loooooove red so much. (I did go crazy and paint the ones in our playroom green.) Paint is cheapâ€¦you can do that without moving or breaking the bank. Go for it!

		<description><![CDATA[LOVE these images!  I just posted yesterday on the exact same topic (but you obviously did a much better job!)  That green bench is to die for...I think I just reconsidered my plan. :)

&lt;em&gt;Aimee your post is great! I loved the picture from the lettered cottage. Isnâ€™t that green bench wonderful?? It would look beautiful in your entryway too â€“ especially with a photo gallery above it.
