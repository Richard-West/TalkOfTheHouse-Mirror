		<description><![CDATA[Kelly
I am an interior designer in Atlanta that also loves to arrange flowers. The beautiful lake house at lake Burton belongs to dear friends of mine and I did all of the flowers for that home for the tour of homes. My husband and I are very blessed to be invited up there several times a year and you are right in that it is perfect!!

&lt;em&gt;How wonderful!  Yes, you ARE very blessed to get to spend time in that lovely lake house.  I know you have to enjoy trips there.  Thank you for reading and leaving your comment Nancy. :)
