		<description><![CDATA[Nice, nice!! I think if I can pick - why not go BIG-- Ocean Bluff--- where all of us could go and enjoy!! Why not?! :) I liked the blues of course and the white trim. Strange how white trim was what we had back in my childhood because it was not too costly to do and then the natural wood trims came along and now I only want white trim and in the process of changing out trim and doors to white! I feel it makes everything so bright and clean looking!! I&#039;m still working on house projects that were delayed because of schedules and health issues but back on track again!! Taking down popcorn ceiling and getting the right look with paint has been a chore! Finally after 6 shades of paint samples I decided on a color -Smokestack-- grayish beige for interior walls! I best like it because it is now ordered!!:) Your blog pictures are my treat and relaxing time interlude! So hot in FL! May as well stay in and paint!! Right?! Hope you are doing well. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f495.png" alt="ðŸ’•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

&lt;em&gt;You are sooo right about the white trim making everything bright and clean looking.  It really makes a difference in a room, doesn&#039;t it?  So glad you are back on track with all your projects again.  Popcorn ceilings are a major pain, so I do NOT envy you for that one.  Hot hot everywhere.  Yes, stay in the AC and paint.  (We keep putting off starting on the outside here because it is too darn hot.)
Take care, and don&#039;t fall off the ladder! :)

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, what an exciting and adventurous trip you had! I love seeing the exteriors and interiors of all of these homes. I&#039;m always drawn to clean white lines with pops of blue, so those type of photos always get my attention! I think I would enjoy staying in any of these beautiful homes!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, you would enjoy staying in them Debbie.  They are all so very cute!  And I am with you.  The clean look of blue and white can&#039;t be beat.
Thank you for stopping in to read the post and leave your kind words here.
