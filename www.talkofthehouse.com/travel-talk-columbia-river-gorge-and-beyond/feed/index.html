		<description><![CDATA[What thoughtful boys and a delicious surprise :)
Sorry it&#039;s been a while Kelly...I&#039;m way behind on commenting ..up to date reading your posts though and enjoying them as always! We&#039;re travelling at the moment and I&#039;ve had a problem with my eye for a few weeks which made reading and writing difficult. It seems to be settling now though.I especially enjoyed reading about all the waterfalls ...loved travelling there with you! By the way I thought Stowe was beautiful! I&#039;ll email you when I&#039;m home. My husband and son kept saying we were on the &quot;Kelly Tour&quot; Good fun!:)
