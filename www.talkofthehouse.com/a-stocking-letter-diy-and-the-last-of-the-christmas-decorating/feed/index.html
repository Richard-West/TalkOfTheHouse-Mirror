		<description><![CDATA[Your home is so lovely.  I love all your attention to detail and
your thoughtful decorating. I love the room above the garage
for games and just visiting.  How nice to have a getaway spot
as well decorated as that!  Is your tree real?  It is breathtaking.

		<description><![CDATA[Your mum is such a talented artist Kelly and has a beautiful home!  Her collection of ivory angels is stunning. I found myself wondering if you draw or paint? Other than your furniture, I mean :)
Thank her for sharing her home with us all. Your family room tree and the boys room as always look great .... bright cheery and welcoming. I think it stands out that as beautiful as your rooms always look, first and foremost it&#039;s a home and not just a very stylish house. 
I enjoy the time after Christmas Day to relax and enjoy all the decorations ...and really appreciate them!
