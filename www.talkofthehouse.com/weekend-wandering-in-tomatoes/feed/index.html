		<description><![CDATA[Yum!  I love tomatoes in season!  My plants aren&#039;t exactly floriferous this year however!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Floriferous?  That will have to be my new word of the day, Cindy.  :)  I have never heard that term before, but I can tell what it means.  I hope your tomato crop improves this summer. Good luck with it!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly- What a great post. I used to LOVE a tomato tart but haven&#039;t had one in years.  My mother used to make something called scalded tomatoes that had a cream base and it was so very good.  Loved this post- xo Diana
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Diana, I don&#039;t believe I have ever heard of scalded tomatoes.  That&#039;s a new one for me! I will have to look in some old cookbooks I have to see if there might be a recipe for them.  Thank you for introducing me to something new for my beloved tomatoes!
I am glad you enjoyed the post.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
