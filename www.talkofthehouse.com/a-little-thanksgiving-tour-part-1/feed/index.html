		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,

I hope your family had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Your home looks so inviting. I had to comment when I read that your family also enjoyed pimento cheese on celery sticks. I have never heard of any other family serving this special treat. It was my Dad&#039;s favorite and something my mother made for him to &quot;tide&quot; him over until the meal was finished. I lost my Dad three years ago on Thanksgiving day and my mom in March of this year. I try to incorporate the memories and special dishes from both sides of the family for my sons. Sadly, they have not developed a taste for the Waldorf salad my grandfather and father in law prepared or the Watergate salad my mom made that I loved but they do love green bean casserole. Have a wonderful Christmas!]]></description>
