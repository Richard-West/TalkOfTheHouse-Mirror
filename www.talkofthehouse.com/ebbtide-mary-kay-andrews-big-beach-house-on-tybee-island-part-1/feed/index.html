		<description><![CDATA[My goodness, this is what I get for not reading my blogs for a week. I just CANNOT BELIEVE you stayed at Ebbtide!! I just LOVE MKA and she is the reason that we vacation in Tybee every year. My husband and I love it so much that we are now working on a plan to make it our future home. My family isn&#039;t big enough to justify a stay at Ebbtide, but we often go down right after Christmas, so I&#039;m thinking that would be a good time to stay there and pay winter rates. Thanks so much for all of the info and pictures. Looks like you hit all of the best places to eat in town, too. Oh, next time you are there see if the city council meetings are showing on the local tv station (crazy, I know. We are big party animals...lol) My husband and I had more fun watching those while we were down there one winter. Hilarious!! MKA really needs to take that council and make a book out of it.]]></description>
