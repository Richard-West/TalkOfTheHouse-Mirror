		<description><![CDATA[Martha Stewart has done an impeccable job with all of her residences.  Her homes are indeed &quot;laboratories&quot; and she is fortunate enough to have the income to make them all beautiful.  Kudos to her.  Although it was not featured, my favorite is her Maine home, Skylands. 

Thank you for this web site.  I enjoyed it.

&lt;em&gt;I&#039;m so glad you enjoyed the post Holly.  Martha seems to do a good job with anything decorating related for sure!  If you like Skylands the best, you need to check out this post:  http://www.talkofthehouse.com/happy-birthday-to-martha-and-me/ It is featured in full there. :)
