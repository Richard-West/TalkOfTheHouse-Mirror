		<description><![CDATA[What a sweet post! I sent the link to my 24yo twin daughters, and one of them told me she was SO going to have a Paradise Falls jar at her wedding. Not that she&#039;s getting married, mind you, nor is she even dating anyone. But she loved the idea! :)
Ellie and Carl&#039;s love story makes me cry every.single.time. Such a precious, precious relationship. After all, isn&#039;t that what love is all about? Thank you for sharing. Loved it all!]]></description>
