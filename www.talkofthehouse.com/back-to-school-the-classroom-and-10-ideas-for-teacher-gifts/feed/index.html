		<description><![CDATA[OH MY GOODNESS!!! I&#039;ve never in all my life seen such a darling classroom!!!!!  Math was the one subject in school I didn&#039;t like, but I think if I&#039;d been in your class I might have changed my mind.   What LUCKY kids!!

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Tessa!  I am so sorry you didn&#039;t like math.  I was always such a geek. :(  It was science and social studies that were never appealing to me...too much to memorize!

		<description><![CDATA[Amazing room, the kids must love it. Elementary teachers have all the fun of an &quot;audience&quot; that appreciates the d√©cor. I always loved to do what I could with the cinderblock walls of my high school classroom. And, too, we were restricted by fire codes for what we could do - nothing on hallway walls. Loved what the other teachers had too, that must be one colorfully decorated school. Pinning this on my &quot;Fall&quot; board, hmmm, maybe I should have a teacher board! You&#039;re right about so many going back this week - just finished wishing many friends in several different districts, best wishes for a successful school year. Here&#039;s wishing all the teachers, here, a wonderful year ahead!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Our walls are that beautiful cinderblock too, Paula.  The fire codes limit creativity quite a bit, don&#039;t they?  The kids do enjoy the rooms, but I think they think of it more as &quot;fun&quot; rather than &quot;pretty.&quot;  YES you should do a teacher board!
