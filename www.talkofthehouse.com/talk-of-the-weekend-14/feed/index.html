		<description><![CDATA[Love blue and white, always have. So crisp and classic. The HGTV house? You mean my new home on the Vineyard? You all can come and visit me, if you&#039;d like. (I&#039;ll apparently be sharing it with my sister-in-law, who thankfully has great taste in seaside décor!)Can&#039;t wait for all the scoop on the BHG photo shoot. Hope you had some rest over the long weekend.

&lt;em&gt;I will definitely come to visit you when you win that gorgeous house on the Vineyard! (even if you have to share it with your sister-in-law.)  It is such a  beautiful home.
