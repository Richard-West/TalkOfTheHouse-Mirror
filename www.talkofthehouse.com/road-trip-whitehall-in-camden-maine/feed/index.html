		<description><![CDATA[What a great spot.  I love how you include the history of things when you can and you notice all the same details that I would look for.  Where as my hubby just says it was fine when asked to describe something.  hee hee Glad we have you for the deets;)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I can totally relate to a husband saying &quot;it was fine.&quot; (My husband AND our sons do that, so it happens a lot around here!)  Our daughter, on the other hand, can tell you every little detail about the place. Must be a girl thing. :)

Happy Fall to You....

Here&#039;s to all things creative for the new season ahead.

&lt;em&gt;Thank you Stephen!  Yes, Maine was amazing, but I think Vermont was even more so.  Our room at the inn we stayed at in Stowe was absolutely gorgeous.
Happy fall to you too!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
