		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
My favorite style of design is the rustic/lodge look.  Toad Hall captures the &#039;look&#039; so perfectly.  I love this home.  I agree, the introduction of yellow accents keep the house from appearing too dark and/or too masculine. Wow, the best for last on our tour of Blackberry Farm.  Thanks.
Karen

&lt;em&gt;Karen – I love the lodge look too. In fact, about 17 years ago we tried to buy a very large log “cabin,” but they would not take a contingency contract on our then unsold home. It worked out for the best since it turned out that the log house had termites…bad! Toad Hall is so well done. Can you imagine the parties there (complete with Blackberry Farm food)? I love this style of home in the fall and winter, but fickle me would probably want something much lighter in the spring and summer. Thank you for adding to the conversation here today.
