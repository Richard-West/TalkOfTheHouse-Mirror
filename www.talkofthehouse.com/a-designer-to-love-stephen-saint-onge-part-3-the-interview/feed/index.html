		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I really enjoyed your post about stephen saint-onge and visited his blog a few times.  It appears his blog is now gone - do you know if he has established a new blog or website?  Thanks!
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Hi Debbie,
I also saw that his old blog is no longer available.  I did a little searching and found this site  http://www.saint-onge.com/  It is not in &quot;blog format&quot; where you can leave a comment.  At first, I did not think it to be a newer one, but it does have his more recent work on it.  So I am thinking this is his most current website.  I don&#039;t know where his art work has gone.  It is nowhere to be found on the site.  I sent them/him a comment through the &quot;contact&quot; address but have heard nothing back.  That&#039;s all the info I have at this point.  If I hear of anything else, I will let you know.  I too enjoyed his site in the past, and was following it through bloglovin.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
