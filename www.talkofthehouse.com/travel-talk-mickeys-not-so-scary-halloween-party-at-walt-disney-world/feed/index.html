		<description><![CDATA[I know you had a grand time!  Lucky to have your Moms and they are lucky to have you and hubby.  Not to mention, your lucky daughter!  What company.

Thanks for sharing Disney.

Now I have been thinking about your gingerbread houses.  Guess what was at the bottom of this post, your dining room from last year.  So I checked it out.  YES, still like it.  Good as I remembered.  So in your busy life give us a post SOON on how to make them/buy them.  I am not crafty.  So I will need lots of time.  Where do I order a kit, what is the best way for me to have JUST ONE?  Please, and thank you.

Even better, give us 12 things we should be doing now to prepare for Christmas and make the gingerbread house HOW TO one on the list.  I know you are a teacher at heart.

Waiting for your next post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What fun you must have had! And how wonderful your mothers were able to go too. I&#039;m sure they had a fabulous time. :) It&#039;s been years since we&#039;ve been to Disney. All my memories are hot and crowded it was. It looks like this would be a great time to go. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re planning a Christmas trip too. It would be very festive in December. Your pictures of the fireworks turned out well and I love your adorable (er, I mean handsome for your husband ;)  ) tee shirts!]]></description>
