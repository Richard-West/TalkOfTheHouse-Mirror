		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the process of redoing the boys bathroom, as I type this new flooring is going down.  After looking at these pics  I&#039;m feeling more inspired.  The photographs/frames (neat  idea), the black painted mirror (thinking I might have to use that) and the lighting are the things I need to focus on to personalize and dress up their space.  Great ideas.....thanks for sharing....guess I&#039;m off to work on the bathroom!

&lt;em&gt;Katherine, sounds like you are off to a good start on your sons’ bathroom! Glad the photos were helpful. Those framed group shots are some of my favorite prints…need to be on the lookout for them in antique shops, but I am surprised no one has made knockoffs. I bet they would sell well! Lowes had some very neat barn type lights (sconces) out of oil rubbed bronze when I was in there the other day. Don’t know if they would work in your house but they were awfully cute!

		<description><![CDATA[Yes to those long pictures! Love them. 

And the blue wallpaper...so pretty!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Isn’t that blue wallpaper a real attention getter, Phyllis? I love it, but I don’t think I am ready to commit to paper again…tooooooo much time putting it up and taking it down in my past. I can’t even keep track of how much wallpapering I did in the first house we built. I think one of your rooms has an identical wallpaper to the paper in my mother’s dining room…cream with a lightly designed floral?
