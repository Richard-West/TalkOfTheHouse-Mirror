		<description><![CDATA[It was indeed cold this past weekend in North Carolina, and I would have loved to been in any of these beautiful homes by a big roaring fire.  I have to admit, I&#039;m longing for a few more crisp fall days…what a talented designer - would love to see her work in person!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It has warmed up here, so I too would like to see more real fall days.  And yes, wouldn&#039;t it be great to see some of Kathleen River&#039;s rooms in person- especially those at Chattooga Club?!

		<description><![CDATA[Ha!  I have all these pictures in my files.  Obviously love her work and it relates to where I live - a log home in the mountains of North Carolina (not Cashiers, but Asheville).  I love it when magazines and blogs feature this style, because it really is a bit of a local vernacular.  We had snow this weekend on the mountain - about six inches!  It was quite a storm with really fierce winds and was our first hard freeze.  So cold weather came in with a bang.  Sat by the fire all day.  Then it got really warm the next day and the snow melted, and was in the upper 60&#039;s today.  Crazy!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Since I love North Carolina so much, it would be logical that I am drawn to this vernacular style.  6 inches of snow!!! Wow.  I know you enjoyed being snug by the fireplace.
