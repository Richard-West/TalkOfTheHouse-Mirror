		<description><![CDATA[Oops!  I should&#039;ve read closer.  Gidget!  That&#039;s awesome.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Julianna – Oh, I remember my first “car date”. He was my same age, and we are still friends today. I think your proposal was super romantic! How sweet of him to go back to that park. I LOVE it! Maybe I should write this down for my boys for future reference. And no problem about reading closer. Glad you liked Gidget!

		<description><![CDATA[We originally met in high school.  He was a senior and I was a sophomore... 17 and 14 years old... he was my first &quot;car date&quot;.  So nine years later when we were reacquainted, he proposed at the sight of our first date--the park where he&#039;d taken me in 1991 to watch fire works for fourth of July.

I&#039;d like to know your answer to this question.  This is a fun one!]]></description>
