		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,
You mentioned the quality of the board.  Have you ever seen a chalkboard constructed of actual chalkboard material, or does it always seem to be chalkboard paint?  I really would like something authentic, like the old blackboards that we used to see in school (yes, I am that old:)  I have a lovely corkboard that my father-in-law made for me using wine corks, and I would love to find something to pair with it in my kitchen. But, so far, that has not happened because I am so darned picky!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;My boards are from Pottery Barn and they are definitely a blackboard.  Our old blackboards in our schools here were actually green. :)  I am picky too about the surface, so I know what you mean.  What a neat idea to make a corkboard out of wine corks!
