		<description><![CDATA[I adore your porch! We are about to build a screened porch with a fireplace and I have been scouring the Internet for inspiration! (That&#039;s me that has been stalking all your Pinterest boards!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)  I am truly in love with your porch and plan on showing my contractor all these beautiful pictures!! They won&#039;t start building until the fall. I can&#039;t wait to start enjoying it and I can only hope it turns out half as beautiful as yours!! You are so talented! Thank you so much for sharing your gifts with all of us!!

		<description><![CDATA[I so love this room. You&#039;ve made it modern and nostalgic, open and airy - but warm and inviting too.  I grew up in CT adoring my grandparent&#039;s wicker filled sunporch. I remember helping my grandmother re-paint all the furniture sunny yellow when I was about 12, and your post reminded me of that. What a great room you&#039;ve created for your family. Bravo.

&lt;em&gt;Belinda â€“ What sweet words! How cheerful a room full of yellow wicker must have been. I would have loved that! Thank you for reading the post and leaving your kind comments here. I hope you have a wonderful weekend!
