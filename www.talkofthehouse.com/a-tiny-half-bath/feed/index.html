		<description><![CDATA[Where did you purchase this pedestal sink?  Thanks!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Anna I think we purchased it at Lowes way back in 1996.  I just checked to see if I could find a name on it anywhere, but there is not one visible to know the brand.  Sorry.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Well that is awesome! I have not seen a bathroom with books on a shelf and it is both funny and smart! 
I love putting little lamps everywhere in the house...they keep it cozy and you don&#039;t feel pressured to turn them off and save money as much. 
Love the tire swing photo idea!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yeah it is funny to have that in there Phyllis, but heck, it does make sense! My family pressures me all the time about turning off the lamps…I hate coming into dark rooms. Thanks for dropping in and leaving your compliment on the room.
