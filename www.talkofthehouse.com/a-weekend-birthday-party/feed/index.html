		<description><![CDATA[Such a great birthday celebration for &#039;Mr. Kelly&#039;. Loved seeing all the pictures of him growing up.  Boy, brought back the memories! Looking at all these pictures of your house....you gotta let me know when it&#039;s looking so fabulous so I can drop by.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It was a very fun party.  We need to get all those guys together again, plus the two who could not make it.  I am thinking perhaps 4th of July if Richard makes it off the Appalachian Trail.  The house is currently missing a dining room table since we moved it upstairs.  Hopefully a new one will be replacing it very soon.  Thanks for reading and leaving a comment Lee!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, you have such a knack for party planning and themed dinners!! I always love your ideas! I especially love this one because we are big sports fans in our house. I&#039;ll probably never get to plan and pull off a party like this for my husband because he has a Valentine&#039;s birthday and we are still buried in a foot of snow here in Southwest Virginia. :) I can live vicariously through you!! :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;My husband&#039;s b-day is the day after Valentine&#039;s, and we were going to do all of this the weekend of Valentine&#039;s Day(and just let breakfast count for the whole Valentine&#039;s thing.)  So yes, you can do this!  The meal prep was pretty easy since it was mostly buy ahead things and grill the meats.
A foot of snow...wow!  I wish we could get just a little of the white stuff.  Not one flake has fallen here this year. :(
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
