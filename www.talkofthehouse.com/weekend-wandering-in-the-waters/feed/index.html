		<description><![CDATA[Hi there (again) Kelly,

I am catching up on your posts after a week away.  First off - you and my daughter share the same birthday:)  Happy birthday!!!!!  Second - Happy Anniversary!  28 years together is wonderful!!
Third - the Waters looks like a wonderful place to live or visit.  I wish that we lived close enough to see it in person.  It reminds me of the planned community where my in-laws moved recently.  It is planned around a golf course, and I describe it as living at a resort, where you are always on vacation.  Wouldn&#039;t that be nice!!!!!  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy (belated) Birthday, I&#039;m glad there was lots of good food and cake. And, Happy Anniversary to you both! Love the town, I did have to look twice at a few pictures because some of those homes have much older twin versions here in Providence. That main avenue with shops and businesses looks charming, too. Now, I want to come and see MKA and Miss Mustard Seed, and shop/sightsee in October - I wonder if I could get a few girlfriends together for a road trip, how fun that would be. Hope the school year has started off well and everything is pretty well organized.... We are enjoying picture perfect weather here: warm days, no humidity, and cool nights, hope it lasts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you for the birthday and anniversary wishes, Paula.  It would make sense that The Waters would look like an older town since it seems so many planned community developers study old towns to find architectural details to copy (and layouts too.)  A visit there in October would make a great girls&#039; roadtrip.  School has started great...loving my new job!  NOT loving the humidity here though.  It is like a sauna!! Jealous of your weather.
