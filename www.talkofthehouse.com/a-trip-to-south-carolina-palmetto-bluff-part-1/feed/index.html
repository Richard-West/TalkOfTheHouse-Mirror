		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly!  This part of the country is a favorite of my husband and myself.  We have been privileged to stay at Palmetto Bluff on two occasions, my husband&#039;s 50th birthday and our 25th wedding anniversary.  Each time we drove thru the gate,  a sense of peace and calm filled the car.  The beauty of our surroundings, charm of our Cottage home, activities and delicious food made both trips extremely special and  difficult to leave at the end of each stay!   Thank you for the beautiful pictures of this special place on the May River.

&lt;em&gt;Susan- We are all so jealous!! How wonderful that you have experienced the beauty of Palmetto Bluff twice. :) I do plan on going back and staying there on another vacation. I certainly felt the sense of peace and calm that you wrote of here as we walked around the resort. Such a gorgeous place.
