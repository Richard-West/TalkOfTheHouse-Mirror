		<description><![CDATA[Love the tote bag!  I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll enjoy it... :)

The rick-rack is TOO cute!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Paula, I have been filling that bag up over and over again since I have received it. (I had to drag it across the floor last night since it was soooo heavy.) I am thinking of adding some rickrack to the curtains in the playroom‚Ä¶might be a 2013 project‚Ä¶we‚Äôll see.
