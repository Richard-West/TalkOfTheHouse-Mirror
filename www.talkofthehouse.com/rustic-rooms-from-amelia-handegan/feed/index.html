		<description><![CDATA[Oh Kelly, you had me at &quot;rustic&quot;.  I think I actually prefer the canopies sans fabric. I prefer the bold, smoothy texture rather than the gauzy, flowy texture that the extra fabric adds to the bed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Julianna – That is interesting that you like the canopy beds like that. I have never had one with the fabric. I do wonder how “claustrophobic” they might make me feel. So glad you liked the rustic-ness of the rooms. Thank you for reading!

		<description><![CDATA[Loving those last two bedrooms!! I would so much rather walk into a room like that than a place where I felt I couldn&#039;t touch anything. I love her work!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Missy – Yes, those last 2 are wonderful bedrooms, and I agree. I would rather walk into a comfortable space than a gorgeous “gallery” any day!
