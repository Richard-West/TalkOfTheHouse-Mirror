		<description><![CDATA[Great job, Kelly! I love to sew. When I&#039;m in the mood! I&#039;ve been sewing since high school. I made slip covers for my sofa and chairs once. NEVER again! Most aggravating mess! But I could cover a stool. Much simpler! If you don&#039;t mind me adding one thing. Trim the corners. It gets rid of all that extra material from the cording and the top and sides and makes them lay (or is it lie) down better. I couldn&#039;t tell in the picture. Was that a zipper foot you used to sew the material around the cord? A zipper foot will get you even closer to the cord for a tighter look. Ok I&#039;ll stop now. I said one thing and that was two. Sorry. Now you have me in the mood to sew. I think I&#039;ll sew some curtains for the boys&#039; room I am redecorating.
-------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Oh I would love any advice you have, Jayne!  I really only know how to &quot;drive&quot; the fabric under the needle and that is about it.(Oh and wind the blasted bobbin...hate doing that!) It was not a zipper foot, and Anita recommended using one too.  So I will have to figure out how to use that next time. I did make an angled cut at the corners kind of like the spokes of a wheel, but I will take your advice and cut some of the fabric out next time. Thank you!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  You are excellent at giving step by step tutorials! I just love how you talk us through it with pictures. You are an awesome Teacher! Thanks for sharing once again.
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Dawn.  I try to think through the steps and add the pictures for clarification.  I guess that just comes from years and years of trying to teach 8 and 9 year old children! :) (They require A LOT of clarification!)
