		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful office, funny sofa story and great retirement news! 

But what I want to talk about are comments. You are always so sweet to send the comment by email, and I&#039;m a miserable, low-life blogger who leaves the comments on my blog. I think if people check the &quot;notify me&quot; option it will automatically send them my reply, but I&#039;m not even sure about that! 

Oh - what to do? I&#039;ve tried three other comment plug-ins and nothing automatically sends them. It stresses me out that people may think I don&#039;t care, and I&#039;m so lame, I have nowhere NEAR 200 comments to think about. 

If you ever want to skip my email, go right ahead. I know you adore every word I write. Hahahaha!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, I do adore every word you write, Leslie Anne! :)  Comments....no, you are most certainly NOT a miserable low-life blogger.  (Cause if you are, then I am one now as well with just replying on the post.)  I  have never used a plug in.  I have always answered them on the post in my comment section of the dashboard, and then I copy and paste and send an email...two steps. A plug in would be great.  Let me know if you find one that works well please!

		<description><![CDATA[The room looks wonderful! your husband did an awesome job on that &quot;coffee Bar&quot;  I like the story about the sofa-so funny. Congratulations on your retirement! 
p.s. one of my favorite shots is the unfinished room with that beautiful bolt of fabric!:::swoon::: I would LOVE to be able to sew like you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Rowe.  I thought my husband did a great job too. :)  I don&#039;t think the sofa story was funny to him at the time, but it is funny now.  I agree with you about that fabric...love it!  Sewing is a much needed skill for those of us who like to redecorate often.
