		<description><![CDATA[I just love Charlie Brown and the gang!  I watched the Thanksgiving special on TV.  So adorable.  I&#039;m thinking of going to see the new movie out in 3D.  Certainly much creativity out there using the Charlie theme.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You and me both!  There is just so much nostalgia associated with the Peanuts gang.  I hope to see the movie as well.

		<description><![CDATA[The TODAY Show must have been following your blog!! They have dressed up like the Peanuts Gang!!  I enjoyed your post and found myself wishing my kids were little again so I could put on a Charlie Brown party!! Loved all the great ideas but really think your ideas are the most clever! Hope this Halloween Weekend finds everyone in your family is feeling well and able to enjoy the Tricks and Treats!;) PS think I will give out &quot;rocks&quot; since no one ever comes to our house -- in the Spooky Woods by the lake!;)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;They were hilarious!!  Thank you for letting me know about them.  (I would have never seen them otherwise.)  From what I understand, they go all out each year.  And thank you for the compliments on my Halloween ideas.  I am nothing compared to those guys though!  You better not have given out rocks!  If someone was brave enough to go to the house in the spooky woods by the lake, they deserved a treat.
