		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kelly! I love having your whole house tour in one spot! I&#039;ve pinned it on my Awesome House Tours board for easy reference. I have a question though...we are getting ready to build and we&#039;re looking for plans... you know all that fun stuff...I looked at your plan and I was wondering if you could post an actual picture of how you changed it or try to describe what changes you made.  Did you add any square footage? Thanks a bunch. I know you&#039;re crazy busy now with school starting so I won&#039;t hold my breath. We&#039;re from Georgia too but now living in Virginia so I remember those early school starts.]]></description>
