		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly, and happy blogiversary!

I live in PA but spent 5 years in NC, where I fell in love with southern living.  A great front porch with a swing in the south is bliss, I say!  We also came to love those NC favorites like pulled pork (vinegary in that neck of the woods) and Brunswick stew!
I found you via Rhoda at SoutherHospitality, and you are now one of my must-read blogs.  I have wood trim and doors in the house I moved into, and you inspire me to make it work. I prefer your trim though ;) And now I want to plank most of the walls in my house!]]></description>
