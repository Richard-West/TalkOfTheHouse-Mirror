		<description><![CDATA[Like Laura, I wanted to know about the box springs.  Thanks for sharing the &quot;how to&quot;.  Dust ruffles can be a bother but necessary and often way too expensive for my budget! It has been a long time since I have visited. Why I ask myself…?  Fixing that now.
Happy Tuesday! Linda

&lt;em&gt;They are often expensive, and they are a royal pain to me to sew. This worked out to be a good solution for that space.  Thanks for stopping by Linda!

		<description><![CDATA[I saw your blog on Hooked on Houses. I love how you have decorated every inch of your home for fall... and the buses all over the house. Wonderful school feeling, isn&#039;t it.

Well, back to work - just wanted to leave a quick hello and say thanks for the great photos.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you for jumping over from Julia&#039;s site, Christine.  I am happy you liked all the back to school things here.  Glad you could take a break from your work to visit.  Hope you will stop in again!
