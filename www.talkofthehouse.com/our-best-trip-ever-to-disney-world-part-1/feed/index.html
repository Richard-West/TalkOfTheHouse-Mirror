		<description><![CDATA[Great post, Kelly! I am glad you went when it was not so crowded.  This brought back great memories. My first trip to Disney World was as a sophomore in high school. Our hs band got to play in the parade and on the steps of the caste. A fellow teacher and I took my kids to Disney for eight straight years for spring break. We closed the park down every single time. It certainly is a magical place. I hope to go again with grandchildren.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I am so glad that you posted this - we were at Disney for 10 days in December - family trip kids &#038; grands - we stayed at Wildernesd Lifge and I was wondering what the lobby looked like without the biggest tallest Christmas tree that I have ever seen! Now, I know! We loved staying there - thank you for sharing!

The Lobby had the fragrance of cinnamon sugar cookies - was that just for the holidays? I wondered about that too!

My best,
Anita]]></description>
