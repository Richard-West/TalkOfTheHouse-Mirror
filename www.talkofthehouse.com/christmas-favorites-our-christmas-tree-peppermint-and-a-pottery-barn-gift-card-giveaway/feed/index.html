		<description><![CDATA[Your tree is gorgeous!!! The whole room is just beautiful!  I love all the red on the tree.  We use the miniature lights.  One tree is done in all white and the other has mutlicolor miniature lights. I loved, loved, loved the big old timey lights that my mother used to use and I do believe they are coming back. Isn&#039;t it amazing that all Christmas trees are beautiful. Once they are decorated, they just seem to come to life in their own way.  The new prelit trees just don&#039;t have enough lights for me.  On one tree alone, we have nearly 5,000 lights, but it is a 12 ft. tree. I have a question? How long do you leave your tree up? Please tell me you don&#039;t take it down Christmas Day.  Love and Best Wishes for you to have a Merry Christmas!]]></description>
