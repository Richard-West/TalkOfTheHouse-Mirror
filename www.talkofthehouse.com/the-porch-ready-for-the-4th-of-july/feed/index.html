		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
I just love your porch and all of your decorations! It is so colorful and inviting - very comfortable and inviting. Love your swing also. I have a large collection of antique wicker also. You are very creative. I enjoy decorating also and may share some pics. I have never done that before so will have to find out how. Thanks for sharing!

&lt;em&gt;Hi Brenda!  I am so happy you like the decorated porch.  Yes, it is colorful!  My love for wicker goes way back to my babysitting days when the doctor for whom I worked had tons of it in his house - including the breakfast room furniture.  Then I bought my first piece as a teenager, and it has continued from there. I bet your antique wicker is gorgeous, and I would love to see your photos of it.
Thanks for reading and commenting!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
