		<description><![CDATA[While I have always known how beautiful your house is on the inside - and had some glimpses of it on the outside, I didn&#039;t realize just how gorgeous your home is on the exterior. Not to mention your property. I love the way the house is situated on the property, plus the drive up to it. I think my favorite photo, perhaps because I&#039;ve not seen that view before,is the one where you feature the holly bushes. Your house has so many appealing architectural features which really makes every perspective of it so pretty! Please most more of your deck and property in the future. Stay warm!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you got to relax and enjoy the beauty of the day, Kelly. I enjoyed seeing your pictures. Is that some RED I spy in your house???
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, Jill that IS red that you are spying.  You are quite observant!  The blue has been replaced with red for February. I still have a little more to work on this weekend.  Glad you enjoyed the pictures of snow from around here! :)
