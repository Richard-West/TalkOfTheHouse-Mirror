-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Welcome, Kellie!  I thank Holly, too, for sending her wonderful readers my way. :)  The baskets in the boys&#039; room came from Target.  They are stacking baskets found in the bath accessories aisle (where the soap dishes and shower organizers are.)  I just hung them &quot;sideways&quot; on the wall.  I kept looking for real locker bins, but the ones I found were all too expensive.  The ones from Target were a good, less expensive option for it.
Thank you for reading!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
