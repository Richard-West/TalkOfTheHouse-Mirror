		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s this about a prize?  I thought all those beautiful photos were delicious prizes every day!  You know, Kelly, out of all of those wonderful images I think I could happily live the rest of my days out in the painting studio or even better the kitchen cottage from the other day (actually if there was a connecting breezeway between the two I could have both of them and travel back and forth).  I guess I&#039;m just a wee cottage lover!  Thanks for the great week of eye candy :)

&lt;em&gt;Cath, oh how I love to get your comments! They always make me smile. I think the little outbuilding/cottages are pretty neat too. You would have to run across a big yard to get from one to the other without a breezeway. If they weren‚Äôt big enough, perhaps you could always use the sleeping porch in the ‚Äúbig house‚Äù to sleep and take a bath. So glad you enjoyed all the posts from Farmhouse Week.
