		<description><![CDATA[Is the Inn worth it? In other words, what perks go away when you stay at this other property? We are celebrating our 30th and want to splurge a bit...but, don&#039;t know if we would be just as happy where you all stayed.  Can you walk to the winery from here? We like to do a lot of walking...Forgive if this is a duplicate comment...not sure if you are moderating and I don&#039;t see mine from yesterday. Thank you so much! Your blog is divine!

&lt;em&gt;Hi Laura!  Thank you for your compliment on the blog. Your earlier comment is about 6 up from the bottom.  I answered your walking distance and shuttle questions earlier today and also sent you an email with the answer.  Please check your spam to make sure it did not go to it. :)  As far as the inn being worth it, it really depends on what you want.  With it you do get a more &quot;luxury&quot; experience, and I believe the rooms are larger.  Here is what it offers that the hotel does not: valet parking, a bellman, 24 hour concierge service, 24 hour room service, fine dining (only casual at the hotel)an on-site spa (hotel guests are also given access to it, but it is not onsite) floral services, in-room movies, custom bathrobe and slippers, a shoe shine service, nightly turn down service, live piano and jazz. The hotel is much closer to Antler Hill Village (right beside it in fact) and they don&#039;t advertise the inn as walkable to the winery...not sure why.  It is the building at the top of the top photo on this post, and Antler Hill Village is at the bottom of the photo.  It doesn&#039;t look all that far, but I don&#039;t think you can just walk down the hill.  The hotel has a long driveway back to the road.That must be why they don&#039;t say it is walking distance to the winery and village.  If you want a true luxury experience, then I think the inn would be your choice.  There is a much more casual atmosphere at the hotel.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m ready for a trip back as well!  Our focus on previous visit was the Biltmore, and didn&#039;t take the time to enjoy Ashveille.  I enjoy your &quot;travel logs&quot; --very detailed with information, including great places to eat, stay, sites to see.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, I can understand how your focus would be on the Biltmore...so much to see there!  But Asheville deserves a lot of time and attention as well.  I hope you get to make a return visit there Kristy. :)  Thank you for the compliment on the travel posts...not sure everyone is a fan of them, but they are like journal entries for me so that I can remember the trips. :)
