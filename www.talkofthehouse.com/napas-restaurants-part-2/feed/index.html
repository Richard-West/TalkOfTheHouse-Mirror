		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly,  Thanks for sharing the NAPA photos.  My nephew and his new bride were married in Napa in April.  I wasn&#039;t able to attend but have enjoyed your pictures and will have to find out if they ate at any of your recommendations.  I am also on the last 2 weeks of school, my preschoolers are ready for a summer break. Have a wonderful evening!! Mickey]]></description>
