		<description><![CDATA[Ahhh... Aunt Kelly this is amazing. I love the whole site and all your ideas and photogaphs but especially reading about and seeing pictures from Papa&#039;s garden. I&#039;m hooked on your blog. So glad it finally came to fruition!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly, just clicked over &#038; noticed that Kevin and Layla shot your house last year.  HOw fun, aren&#039;t they the best?  And you started a blog after that &#038; you&#039;re doing a nice job with it.  My dad not only builds things, he grows veggies too. I&#039;ll be sharing more of our bounty on my blog, as I do every year. Looks a lot like your table!  We just had our first tomato sandwich of the year &#038; boy, was it good.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thanks Rhoda! Kevin and Layla were a lot of fun to have around, and the fact that it was almost Christmas made it even better. I could kick myself for not getting my picture made with them. Too tired from decorating to think!
Your parents are amazing! I remember reading about your dad’s garden last year, I believe. It looked wonderful! We’ve had more rain this year, so I am thinking the gardens should do better. We’ve not had tomato sandwiches yet, but we did just have blt’s. yummy!
Thank you for clicking over and leaving your kind words (especially with all you have to do right now.) Best of luck with Haven. I hope/plan to be there next year, and yes y’all are doing it next year again, right?
