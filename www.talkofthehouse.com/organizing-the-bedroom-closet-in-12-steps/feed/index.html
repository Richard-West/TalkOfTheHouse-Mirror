		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly! The closet is amazing, I LOVE the red boxes. I have a question about your matching hangers. I love having my clothes on uniform hangers, but how do you handle dry-cleaning? My husband and I both dry-clean more than 50% of our clothes, especially our business clothes. Do you take them off of the dry cleaning hangers and move them to your wooden ones? This seems like it would be a huge pain - plus with pants I think they would get messed up. Your thoughts are appreciated!
Thanks,
Megan

&lt;em&gt;Megan, we have hardly any dry cleaning here.  You probably do more in a month than we do in a year.  And my detail obsessed brain does move them from the wire cleaner&#039;s hanger to the wooden ones, but you are right.  If you do as much as you do, it would be a pain.  The pants would not get messed up though, because I think the bar across on the wooden hangers actually does fine. It is a very smooth bar, so it does not snag, and the pants still keep their nice crisp fold. Time versus looks though, I would probably have to rule in favor of saving the time and keeping them on the dry cleaner&#039;s hanger...especially if you and your husband work outside the home.  The purpose of organization is to save time, so keep all your dry cleaning in one section, and at least that would be uniform together.
Hope this helps!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I see!  Lol. I&#039;m sorry.  I misunderstood you.  When you said you had to turn the boxes in the other direction, I thought  you meant 180 degrees, not laterally.  Kind of made me do a Scooby Doo on that one, lol!  I had to come back to the blog and re-read that section to understand.  Ah, good call!  Thanks so much, Kelly, for answering me.  All the best to you.]]></description>
