		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this terrific post! My late Godmother (from Cape Cod) bought me Heart of the Home back when it first came out and she got it autographed by Susan Branch for me.  What a beloved keepsake this is for me.  Thank you for the beautiful reminder!!! :)

&lt;em&gt;You lucky girl Jean!!  You own a very special book - not only an original, but also an autographed original!  We are all jealous. :)

		<description><![CDATA[I am reading the blogs I missed from new to old and I got so excited when I saw pictures of your old house.  Thank you for sharing a little more about you.  I don&#039;t know how I haven&#039;t heard about Susan Branch before now...but she has nothing on your lettering.  Maybe now that you are retired there is a book in you??
Would love to win your giveaway.
