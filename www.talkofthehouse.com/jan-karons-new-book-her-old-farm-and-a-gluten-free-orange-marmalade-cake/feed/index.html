		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, 
     You are the one who introduced The Mitford series to me about a year ago.  I found them all at a thrift store remember??   I have read every one of them now.  And have fallen in love with the characters as you have.  Recently I drove home to Mississippi and stopped in a Cracker Barrel for lunch...they had the latest book in an AUDIO SERIES!!!  EEK!!!  I was driving with 2 kids watching a TV with earphones, a dog who slept the whole way, so..... I steadily popped those CD&#039;s in and had a glorious time beboppin down to MS.  I look forward to this newest book.  Thanks for sharing with us!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I DO remember that Jennifer, and I was jealous you found such a bargain!  And I LOVE that you were able to travel listening to the stories.  How absolutely wonderful!  The next time we take a road trip, I am going to have look for the audio versions to take along with us. :)

		<description><![CDATA[Why is Lace&#039;s invite addressed as Lacey Harper Harper? Shouldn&#039;t it have been Lace Turner Harper? I remember when she first appeared in the books and Cynthia called her Lacey and she was sternly corrected that Lace was her name. 

I&#039;ve wanted to make orange marmalade cake for a long time. Maybe this fall I&#039;ll find an occasion for such a showstopping cake. 

Have you listened to the audiobooks of the Mitford series? The narrator, John McDonough, is just wonderful. He sings the hymns which I love because I&#039;m not familiar with those songs as a Yankee Catholic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Good question!  And it is one that will be answered when you read the book. :) (There really is a legit reason for it.)  
You definitely need to make the OMC.  Remember it is much better refrigerated when you make it.
I have not listened to any of the audiobooks, but I want to.  And I have heard so many good things about the narrator!  If we have another road trip, I plan on bringing some along with me.
