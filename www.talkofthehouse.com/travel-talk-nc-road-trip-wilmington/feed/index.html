		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed your view of Wilmington! Our experience there was long ago when our children were very young and we were staying on the beach! It was hurricane season and the rain came down in buckets!! I was so scared because I didn&#039;t know how slowly hurricanes travel and I just insisted we pack up and get back to the hills of Ky!! The couple of days on the beach was nice but breezy and the traveling inland with all the rain was terrible. So needless to say -- I enjoyed your photo visit much more than mine! Thank you as always for letting your readers follow along. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="ðŸ˜Š" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

&lt;em&gt;That does NOT sound like a very fun trip to the beach!  I hate driving in the rain, so it would have been very stressful to me too.  Glad you enjoyed the post.  Perhaps you should fit in another trip to Wilmington to give it another chance - on days with sunny weather! :)
