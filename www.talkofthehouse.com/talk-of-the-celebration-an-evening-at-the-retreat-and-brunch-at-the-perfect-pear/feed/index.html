		<description><![CDATA[You are certainly a &quot;party girl&quot; Kelly! Congrats to your husband on retiring. So glad you had a great Valentine&#039;s celebration. That food looks scrumptious!! Looking forward to hearing about the next party!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yes, lately I have been a party girl, but things are finally slowing down in that department.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I hope you had a good Valentine&#039;s Day too Debbie.
