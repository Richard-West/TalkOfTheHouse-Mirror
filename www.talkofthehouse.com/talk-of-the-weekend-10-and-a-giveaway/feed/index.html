		<description><![CDATA[Merry Christmas,Kelly. I&#039;ve been enjoying your blog for over a year now, and thought I would take a minute to describe why I like your personal house decorating so much.  I like seeing the casual simplicity of the things you use, such as the glass jars, together with the graphic, colorful impact of such things as your red plaid curtains.  As I look away from my computer with the pictures of your beautiful, organized house, I think maybe I need to edit the things in my own house, LOL!  I&#039;m still amazed that you work full time as a teacher and still have time to decorate for each new season so beautifully, write this blog and tend to your family. Thank you so much for your attention to all of your readers with your beautiful pictures, wonderful recipes and heartfelt thoughts.  I wish you and your family a memorable Christmas!]]></description>
