		<description><![CDATA[I follow you on Pinterest and didn&#039;t realize you were a teacher!I too, was a full-time teacher for many years. Until I too, took a (part-time) position as a Math teacher! Like you...I am so much happier! And also...like you...one of my favorite parts of the year is decorating my classroom. Your classroom is gorgeous! What a comfortable learning space you have made for those lucky children. I absolutely love your style! Thank you for sharing!:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your daughters dorm room.  Wish mine had looked like that.  Love the green trunks, could you tell mr where you bought them.  I could use some nice looking storage containers.  Thanks and keep up the good stuff coming!  Love when I see you have a new post.

&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your super nice comment Mary!  I got the trunks from Target.  Here is the link:  http://www.target.com/p/threshold-woven-willow-basket/-/A-14332048?reco=Rec&#124;pdp&#124;14332048&#124;SolrSearchToView&#124;search_page.null_no_search_results_1&amp;lnk=Rec&#124;pdp&#124;14332048&#124;SolrSearchToView&#124;search_page.null_no_search_results_1 They came unfinished and we sprayed them with a green Valspar spray paint from Lowes. I also have one on top of our daughter&#039;s desk in her bedroom at home.  That one was sprayed a khaki color.  You can see it here:  http://www.talkofthehouse.com/daughters-bedroom-redone/ 
They hold a lot!
