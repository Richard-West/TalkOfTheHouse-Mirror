		<description><![CDATA[Love all of your ideas!  I can&#039;t wait to see what you do with it.  I&#039;m loving the last ones you posted because you seemed to like those best and think they fit best.  I&#039;m such a firm believer that what you love is what is right...there are no right answers.  It&#039;s your home after all.  Excited to see the final product!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Lindsay – Thank you for your sweet comment! I, too, believe you should love what you put in your rooms and not be bound by trends. And obviously, I do love red. But goodness at all the beautiful color ways I saw yesterday in fabrics in Atlanta…I could love most ANY color after seeing all of them.
