		<description><![CDATA[Oh the serenity!  I too am very into the whole grey and white at present.  They look like they did such a good job.  Calming colours and quality workmanship everywhere.  Who would not want to stay there!  You would not be able to get me to leave!  LOL!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It was a perfect job.  Both of the owners are VERY detail oriented and left nothing out.  It is truly a gorgeous place to be.  I&#039;m with you Carole - it is hard to leave that place. :)
