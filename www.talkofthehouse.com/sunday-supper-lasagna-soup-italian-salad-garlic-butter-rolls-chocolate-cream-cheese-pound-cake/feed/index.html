		<description><![CDATA[So, we had another round of snow late last night, only a &quot;dusting&quot; as they say. However, I&#039;ve noticed that most people still have all their Christmas wreaths up and it is almost February... But, with the fierce cold and once a week storms, well, it&#039;s like a Christmas card setting around here. I say, it&#039;s up with the Valentine dÃ©cor tomorrow, snow or no. I would have enjoyed that meal on Sunday, everything looked delish and as much as I love dessert, the soup is calling my name. We&#039;ll be having a lot of days to make up at school for, I fear, there&#039;s more snow to come. (I&#039;d be happy if it went above twenty for a few days!)
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That is amazing that Christmas is still up.  I would LOVE it (as I am STILL listening to Christmas music here. :) ) It is supposed to be 60 degrees here this weekend.  At least you are consistent in your temperature.  We are never the same from one week to the next!
Stay warm!

		<description><![CDATA[The best pound cake recipe I&#039;ve ever, ever eaten is a Barefoot Contessa orange pound cake.  Wow.  It&#039;s a life changer and a crowd pleaser.  Amazing.  I would use that recipe - get rid of the orange zest and juice - throw in a couple of TB&#039;s of cocoa (and maybe some instant coffee which always goes well with chocolate) and I bet you&#039;d be in business.  Her pound cake is great with tea or an Easter dessert.  Yum.  Love your blog!
-----------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you Elle.  I think I will try that pound cake in the orange version.  Everything I eat doesn&#039;t have to be chocolate. LOL Thanks for the recommendation!
