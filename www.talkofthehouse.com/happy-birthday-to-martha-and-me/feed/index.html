		<description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday on your special day! Plus, Happy Anniversary, too! So thankful that my brother in law married you so we can be related! You are correct, it surely took him LONG enough to pop the big question but you waited patiently! He has always been quite deliberate with his actions! :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Janna – Thank you! I’m glad we are related too. I must admit that I was not patient in waiting though. There were MANY times I told him, “I know you want to marry me. What are you waiting for?” :)
