		<description><![CDATA[I just want you to know that your home is a really brilliant combination of colors and materials. It&#039;s modern, warm and bright, without being trendy. Timeless, classic, cozy and fresh. It takes me to allot of pleasant places, past and present. It&#039;s different in the best way. Bravo!

Would you mind sharing where you were able to purchase the end table in the great room, and the round table pictured by the Christmas tree? It&#039;s hard to find and end table like that in that stain. Really beautiful. 

We are building, and I find your home extremely inspiring. I have been leaning toward the all white painted panneling and white windows and trim, but I know that it&#039;s trendy and may feel cold. Your walls and windows are really beautiful combined with your choices of colors and materials everywhere else. Thank so much for sharing the pics and inspiration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for starting your blog. I love it! I love the way it is set up and the ease of maneuvering through it. It is so reader friendly( many require you to click and click and click to get to what you want to read!) I have thoroughly enjoyed reading what you have to say and I thank you for sharing your beautiful home. You have great style. Yours is a blog I always read, even if I miss a few days I always go back and read everything I missed. I look forward to seeing what 2013 has in store!]]></description>
