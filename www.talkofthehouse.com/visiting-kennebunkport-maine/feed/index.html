		<description><![CDATA[I have also never had a Lobster roll and would most definitely make a pig out of myself if I had some!
Yes to those yellow rockers! They are deep which looks comfy for long-legged ppl like me.

		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful area! Love that Jonathon Adler room. Can you believe it? I have never tasted a lobster roll before. I must remedy that soon!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It was a very beautiful area Susan â€“ not only in the buildings but also in the natural beauty of the landscape. I had never tasted a lobster roll until we went on that trip. I believe eating them every single day contributed to my becoming allergic to shellfish the following summer â€“ no proof just think it. So if you start eating them, donâ€™t be a glutton like I was! :)
