		<description><![CDATA[As I looked I thought, &quot;Will the readers really like this house?&quot;. I was happy most did not like it either. The outside is pretty but I only liked the grouping of bird paintings and the botanicals inside. The kitchen was way too dark and that dining room would drive an attention deficient person crazy. Draping that ceiling might be a little ridiculous. I am with the other girls, cleaning that would not make me happy. I still love you but that house....not so much.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I knew that most readers would not like it.  I had about 300 photos to go through and had originally thought about breaking it into 2 posts, but then I decided it would not be worth it because most would not want to see part 2 after part 1. :( So they all got whittled down to what was in the one post.  There were a number of good ideas in the house, and like you, I liked some of the art.  I think all of us here just prefer a different style than what the target audience of Southern Living likes.  Glad you still love me even though you didn&#039;t love the house Kathy! LOL :)

		<description><![CDATA[When I visit model homes or idea houses, I try to think about how I would like for it to look if I lived there.  I think the architecture of the home is nice. I could go for a house that has a bathroom for every bedroom. Wouldn&#039;t that be nice? The porch looks inviting and relaxing. Love the two sinks in the kitchen and the built ins in the living room. What a treat for you to be able to visit another special home. Thank you for sharing it with us, Kelly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;That is a very good thing to do, Sherry.  I have a hard time doing that in a fully furnished (often overdecorated) room.  You have better skills at envisioning than I do. :) Thank you for pointing out a number of positive things about the house.  There were some very pretty ideas in it, and I am glad you could see them! :)
