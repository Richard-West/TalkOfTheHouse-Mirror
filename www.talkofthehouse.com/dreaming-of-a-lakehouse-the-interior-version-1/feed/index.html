		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, you are so right about God&#039;s timing. We looked for a lake house or lot for a number of years. It took quite a while for me to convince my husband that we could build a new home and have what we wanted for about the same price as buying an older home. When we finally decided to pursue a lot I called the realtor only to discover that the lot had been taken off the market that day as the owner had lost his battle with cancer and the kids were going to take some time to sort things out. A year later I drove by again to see the for sale sign was out again. I made the call again and the rest is history. Our forever home is quite large and our lake house is about half the size at 2400 square feet. We were able to find a great builder who built and finished the main floor of 1200 square feet in 90 days. We spent the next 6 months finishing the basement for the remaining 1200 square feet. This may be the best decision we have ever made. Our adult children love coming here and we live here 6 months each year since it is located within 30 minutes of my husband&#039;s job and our church and within 45 minutes of our forever home. Keep dreaming and planning! I can&#039;t wait to see this dream come to reality!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;How wonderful Pat!! I love how the timing worked out (even though I know you had to be disappointed when you could not get it initially.)  And what a smart idea to live in part of it totally finished and then finish the basement after you move in.  I will keep dreaming, and I do hope we get to make that dream a reality one day.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uh oh!! Sounds dangerous.  I think you are like me and are overthinking it!  Can&#039;t wait to see version 2, but version one sounds so you!! Love those Hudson Bay Towels...what a find!!
------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Yeah...very dangerous.  I always overthink things to the last detail.  Aren&#039;t those Hudson Bay towels great?!  I was surprised to find how many things are marketed with those stripes.
