		<description><![CDATA[I just happened across your site while desperately looking for paint colors/ideas for our VERY tall walls - our whole main floor is 20 foot ceilings painted in &quot;builder&#039;s beige&quot;. I may have missed it but would you be able to tell me the paint color you used? It looks great with the wood which is very similar in tone to ours. You have an amazing eye, I am jealous as I was born with zero sense of style beyond &quot;ohh, that looks great!&quot; when someone does it for me. I will probably be stealing a lot of ideas from you ;)
------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;You steal all the ideas you want Patty!  Glad you can use things from here.  :)  The room was painted with an old K-Mart line from Martha Stewart in a color called Twine.  It is no longer made, but it matches a Benjamin Moore paint color called Brandon Beige.  Lowes carries a Valspar paint that is also very close (although a tad darker) called Lyndhurst Timber.  
Hope this helps!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[This is my first time to your site.  My friend told me about it.  I am looking for a fabric to recover our sofa.  Yours look so pretty and I love the neutral color.  Do you share your color and type of fabric?  Can&#039;t wait to sit and look at all the other pictures.
--------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt; Hi Judy!  Welcome!  Please thank your friend for sending you over. :)  The fabric on our sofa is made by Kaufmann.  It is called Perth, and the colorway that we have it in is Teastain.  It looks more brown on the computer screen than it is in real life. It is really a good true neutral. Hope that helps!
 I also hope you will enjoy the blog.
 Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
