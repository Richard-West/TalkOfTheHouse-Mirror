		<description><![CDATA[Kelly:  when I look at your drawers and cabinets, I realize just what a spartan life I live.  I have two sets of cloth napkins that I never use, and two sets of dishes (one is the everyday china from my bridal showers/teas 40 years ago).  I have no words when I look at all the stuff you have.  Yep. Spartan.  That&#039;s me. p.s. - you did a great job of organizing but I&#039;d never let you see MY messy drawers.  LOL  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly! You&#039;re so right January went off so fast! And YES organization is at the top of our list too. Unfortunately we first have to do a lot of building work in our home so I can get a little frustrated with my organizing &#039;options (ahhh, open shelves with a toddler! ^^).But we keep going! :-) Congratulations for the great work! It looks beautiful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I don&#039;t know how in the world you can handle open shelves with a toddler!  Goodness!  Thank you for the compliments on the organization.  There is plenty more of it needed around here.  Good thing I am retired! :)
