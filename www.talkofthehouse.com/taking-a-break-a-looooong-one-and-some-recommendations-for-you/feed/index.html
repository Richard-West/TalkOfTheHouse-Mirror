		<description><![CDATA[Hello Kelly,

I have loved you home since the first time I saw it.  I have pinned it, bookmarked it, and even printed and clipped it for my Idea book and board.  I especially loved it at Christmas.  We are starting a remodel soon also, and I am inspired by many of your homes features and will be incorporating them into our remodel.  So beautiful!!!!

I also loved that the feature about the Tennessee Farm House of the Schmidt&#039;s was added to this.....I especially love all her drapery fabrics.  I would love to know where the textiles were purchased.  I would love to have some in my home.....if you can help me find them, that would be great!  

Again, happy remodeling!!!!]]></description>
