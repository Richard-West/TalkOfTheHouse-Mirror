		<description><![CDATA[I love anything with lemon. It smells great and tastes good and is a wonderful, natural cleaner. Can you imagine ice tea without a slice of lemon? Once, when I was in Massachusetts and ordered tea, they brought me lemon in a squeeze packet. Like my mother says, that is just tacky. Go the extra mile and cut up a real lemon for either hot or iced tea. No artificial lemons in beverages please. Loved also the reminder about the shampoo Lemon Up. Can&#039;t believe I had forgotten it. All the girls in my dorm used Lemon Up and also ironed their hair to straighten it. Those were the days!

&lt;em&gt;No, I cannot imagine iced tea without a lemon slice (or a glass or water without it either.)  I agree with your mom about the packet of lemon juice being tacky.  Just don&#039;t even offer it, if that is all you can do.  I remember the hair ironing, but never did it.  I used to think that was sooooo unhealthy for your hair, but it probably is no worse than all the blow drying and curling iron use we do today.

		<description><![CDATA[Oh Kelly,

 You are teasing me! I do like lemons and always have them around to go in my tea but you know I love those green Kate Spade dishes! I love green! I have been gifted a canopy green Kitchenaid mixer for Mother&#039;s Day this year! Thanks for the inspiration! I will have to be on the look out for things with limes on them to compliment my mixer now. Happy Mother&#039;s Day! Thanks for sharing. Take care.

Dawn
