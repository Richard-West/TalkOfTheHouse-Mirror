&lt;em&gt;I thought so too, Dana! And they used different dogs in many of their kitchen photos.

		<description><![CDATA[These are a talented group of ladies. I am familiar with most of these photos cause I love white kitchens!!! When I moved to Greenville in 1988 white kitchens were becoming the rage in Atlanta. I am very conservative so I debated doing raised paneled oak and tile floors or white cabinets and wood floors. I went with the oak and tile my biggest mistake ever. White is still the rage almost 30 years later and wood floors will never date. I no longer reside in the same home and I had my cherry cabinets in this one  painted BM white dove and love them. I have wood flooring now as well. Classic,classic, classic.
I love &quot;falling back&quot; but &quot;springing forward&quot; maybe not so much. Lol!
On another note I just got around to reading &quot; Somewhere safe with somebody
good&quot;...Jan Karon has an amazing gift - I truly did not want it to end.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Your kitchen does sound classic classic classic!  I am glad you were able to get your white cabinets on your latest home Victoria.  Like you, I love falling back in the fall, but tomorrow morning is going to be super hard for getting up.  (But I will love the extra light in the evening.)
I did not want Jan Karon&#039;s latest book to end.  I&#039;ve said it before...it was just like being with old friends!
