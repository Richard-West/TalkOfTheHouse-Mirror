		<description><![CDATA[I loved the picture of the stove showing the pies. My home was built in 1961 and this is stove we had installed at that time. It went out about 6 months ago and was told could not be repaired because no parts available since so old, but I had a friend who is an electrician and he said he would rewire it for me and he did and it works like new.  I was so happy. Always enjoy your blog. One of the best.  Thanks for all the fun and interesting readings.  Jean Roberts]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly,

I love your travel blog posts.  Could you possibly share your travel research tips with your readers sometime?  You always seem so prepared and thus are able to fit a lot into a trip.  Even with apps and our phones, we seem to waste time trying to figure out what we&#039;re going to do once we get to a new destination.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Continued fun and safe travels, 

Missouri Barb

PS  Love your decorating posts, too!  ;)]]></description>
