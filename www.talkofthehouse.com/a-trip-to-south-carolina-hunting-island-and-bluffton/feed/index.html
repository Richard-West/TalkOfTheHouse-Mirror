		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m itching to hit the road. Hopefully, soon. Loved being &quot;Joe Tourist.&quot; And that food looks divine.

&lt;em&gt;Dayle – Thank you! I hope you get to go on a trip soon, too. The food was quite delicious (and more than I could eat!)

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly, I have thoroughly enjoyed your South Carolina travels!  I especially liked seeing the lighthouse--I&#039;ve always thought it would be neat to live in a lighthouse keeper&#039;s house!  

Can&#039;t wait to see what&#039;s next!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Ann – When I was young, I read about a lighthouse keeper’s cottage on an island that you could rent to stay in. I cannot remember where that was, but like you, I thought it would be fun (and I thought romantic too!)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
