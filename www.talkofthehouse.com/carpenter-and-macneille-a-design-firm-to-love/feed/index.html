		<description><![CDATA[The thing that caught my attention right away was the size of the houses. I would love to have a large house! Of course a house like those is way above our pay grade! So, I&#039;ll stick with my little house. Besides, it&#039;s all I can do to keep up with this house! haha. I love the New England feel as well. I think it&#039;s really more of a airy, beach feel that comes with New England homes. And being form Amelia, you know how much I love the beach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gorgeous renovations. I feel like that first home is one I have driven by a few times, I wonder where it&#039;s located? As much as I drooled over the transformations, there&#039;s something in me that loves the hodge-podge architecture of the originals. All that history of the home and the family that could be seen in each addition. Then, I see the new home and I am truly amazed. (By the way, now that I&#039;m retired I think I should start a cookie business out of my kitchen, yum!)]]></description>
