		<description><![CDATA[I think I might have told you this before but you take wonderful photos.  You also know how to tell a story with them.   I love these shops and the wedding venue is beautiful and frankly made me a little teary eyed.   Why do I get teary eyed even watching a wedding of people I don&#039;t know.  lol
Great post,
DiAnne
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Thank you (again :) ) DiAnne!  I do the same thing and get all teary eyed at weddings - yes even of strangers.  We just have big hearts! (At least that is my excuse.)
Thank you for reading and taking the time to comment on the post.
Have a fun Friday!

		<description><![CDATA[That is the most adorable community so of course the shops had to be fabulous too!! What fun to browse through. :) Such cute names too. I think I would have a weakness for seaworthy. :) Haha, and all of the shops with sweets!! :D Looking forward to the interiors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It is!  It could have been more fun, if I had had longer....with 2 guys I felt guilty taking any time on this trip to peruse the town. But I knew we would not be back for a very long time.  Needs to be a girls&#039; trip!
