		<description><![CDATA[Can I ask you, how do you get such great pictures of the FOOD when you have a dinner/party? At my house everyone wants to dig right in and gets annoyed when I am trying to take pictures. UGH. Your menu sounds fabulous!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;My crew is very patient with me - all except for my dad.  When he is here, I am lucky to get any photographs! I use a tripod, and my family and friends just wait a few minutes for me to take photos...and they all know to turn off the overhead lights when I am doing it. (They shouldn&#039;t complain...they&#039;re getting free food, right? LOL)  My family has even gotten used to my photographing their meals in restaurants.  (And with smartphones and all, it seems to be the norm lately that many folks are taking pictures of their food.)

		<description><![CDATA[I am seeing your beautiful home for the first time today!! Very gorgeous!! I have red and pink through-out my home. It is a very small condo that my daughter Debbie, (she has Downs Syndrome), and I have just moved into. Trying to find room for everything has taken me longer than usual!! So loved your Mother&#039;s Day dinner. It looked just wonderful and inviting. The food sounded delish also!! Looking back at your Christmas decor since I&#039;m a crazy for Christmas kind of girl!! Will enjoy following your site!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Welcome Sandra!  I am so glad you found the blog.  Good luck getting everything in place in your new condo.  Moving is A LOT of work!!  Thank you for the compliment on our Mother&#039;s Day meal.  I think &quot;girl-y food&quot; is probably my favorite food category. LOL  (I always loved weddings because the receptions had the best things to eat!) If you love Christmas you will enjoy the December posts since I am also addicted to the season....waaay too much holiday decor around here then.  (And can you believe Hobby Lobby already has Christmas items out??) 
Hope you will visit again when you get a break from unpacking. :)
