		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Kelly.  Do I want to talk about houses?  Boy, do I ever!  My husband and I are thinking about building and I am looking for a craftsman/cottage style floor plan that meets all our needs.  When this house is built, that is it!  We will live there until we die, so I want to get it right.  My problem is analysis paralysis.  I&#039;ve looked at literally hundreds of plans, but cannot find what I want.  Any suggestions for me?  

So looking forward to your reply,
Donna
&lt;em&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis paralysis is a good term.  Everyone&#039;s needs are different, so what works for one person of course may not work for another. We looked for years and toured many open houses - taking photos and writing notes along the way. We started with a Southern Living plan - Lakeside Cottage, but even after purchasing the blueprints we made MAJOR changes - i.e. moving the master bedroom and the screened porch, totally reconfiguring an entire wing, and using a room on the plan for something totally different than what it says. (And we knew when we purchased the blueprints we were going to do that.) So you can find a plan that you like and make changes. I have often said that I would like to build Blount Springs Retreat if we were building again, but even with that, I am sure there are changes we would make. Take a plan that has an exterior you like to a builder and ask if all your requirements can be done in the floor space available in the plan.  A good builder should be able to tell you if something would work. I had a lot of requests:  no porch off the great room, 3 separate bedrooms, walk in closets in all bedrooms, a porch off the kitchen, a window in the kitchen, wood floors throughout, a playroom, an office, tons of bookcases throughout the house, a separate pantry.  I wish we would have put in a linen closet and a bigger space in the dining room and the laundry area, but if that is all that I would change, I don&#039;t think that is too bad. Our house is very livable.  Good luck with finding or creating a plan that you love!

		<description><![CDATA[I love James Farmer and follow his blog. Your Decemebr post from last year was what turned me on to him, I loved that room. I would love to have his cookbook.
It is hard to say what my favorite southern thing to cook is, there are so many. One thing I love to make is pimento cheese. You have to be a southerner to appreciate it and I could eat it every day.
Thanks again for your wonderful informative blog and the great giveaway.]]></description>
