		<description><![CDATA[Are you okay?  If you are off somewhere having fun, or busy with your daughter&#039;s graduation fine.  But just let us know you are okay.
We love you and selfishly miss your post.   So just give us a shout out.
I received my goodies, they all came that Monday. Thank you so much.  Cindy]]></description>
