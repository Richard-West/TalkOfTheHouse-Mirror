		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to make a correction to my earlier post, I was talking about the two black and white prints beside the door.  Realized later they weren&#039;t the diplomas.  ooops
-------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I thought you were probably talking about the ones to the right of the door.  I have not really shown you where the diplomas are, but I love your idea. :) I will move those 2 photos to over by the desk like you suggested (this weekend.) Now I need to find a place for the photo of our son that is currently there, and I do want to use it because it is one of my most favorite pictures of him. :) (The domino effect again!) I might move one of the diplomas down and sandwich the photo between both of the diplomas because that area is separate - kind of like a tiny hallway into the room.
Thanks again for the suggestion Cindy!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelly, I am not surprised at all, you know what works for you.  I was more surprised when you showed us all the gallery walls...you don&#039;t do busy.  (Neither do I, I can&#039;t relax)
One thing I didn&#039;t feel good about, the diplomas.  You don&#039;t have balance, one side is heavy then you have the other side with 2 pictures.  I would like to see the diplomas over in the corner where the baskets are. Mimic the bed wall.  Just a suggestion.
As always thanks for sharing your beautiful home. 
PS  I love the black and yellow.
