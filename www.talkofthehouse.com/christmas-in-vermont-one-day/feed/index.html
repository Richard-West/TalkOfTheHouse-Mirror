		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

That is such a pretty inn.  I would want it to be dressed in snow, will they refund your deposit if it isn&#039;t snowing? :-)
We took our adult sons to London one year and we left on Christmas day.  It&#039;s a wonderful day to travel (or was) since there weren&#039;t very many travelers.  We had a wonderful time.  It was fun to celebrate Christmas Eve in our home (a tradition in our family) and then get up and travel.
