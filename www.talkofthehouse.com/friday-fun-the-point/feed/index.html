		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Rustic Elegance&quot;  Oh, you are so right!  Love the wood boats.  Drool fest.  We have been spending the last couple of weekends up in lower Wisconsin at a lake and saw quite a few older Chris Craft boats.  Nothing like the sound of the inboard motors...  Your right, I am not rich or famous, but there is something about the serenity of a lake....sigh.  So relaxing and calming.  &#060;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just watched the video and realized that it is time to start saving my pennies!  This would be our dream vacation - on the water and near the woods~
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;It would certainly be a dream of a trip.  They have families that reserve the entire place for weddings there.  Can you imagine how beautiful that would be??!
