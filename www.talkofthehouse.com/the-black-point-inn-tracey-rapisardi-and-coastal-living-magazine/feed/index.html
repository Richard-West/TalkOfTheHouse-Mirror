		<description><![CDATA[Boy Kelly, you have really made me fall in love with Maine! All of the beautiful photos you have shared...that&#039;s the only way I will ever get there! Ha, ha! It seems like the gardens, well, all of outside, seems more sharper, crisper, more alive(?) probably not the right word but you probably know what I mean...am I right?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Well I am glad you are liking it Kim! I have one more post tomorrow, and that will be the end of the ‚Äúvacation.‚Äù I know what you mean about the landscaping‚Ä¶it is gorgeous because of their weather. They get lots more rain than we do here, so there vegetation is so much more lush‚Ä¶.plus they don‚Äôt have the heat. When we left Maine, we drove to Cape Cod and stayed at an inn there that had THE most beautiful gardens. I was taking pictures and writing down notes and my husband said, ‚ÄúYou know that will never work in our zone with our climate.‚Äù Darn it! Guess I will just have to move north. :)
