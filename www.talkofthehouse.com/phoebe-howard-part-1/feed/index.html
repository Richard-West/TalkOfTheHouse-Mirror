		<description><![CDATA[I do love her formality.  I think lots of families on the web are trying to find that balance.  I know with three young boys in our home, we try to have furniture that is fort friendly, but feels grown up when they&#039;re all in bed.  I find my balance with gold gilded frames, but more casual (aka washable) fabrics.  I&#039;ll put a pic on my family blog so that you can see what I&#039;m talking about.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Julianna – It is all in finding that balance isn’t it? I love your “fort friendly” description! So true. And then there still has to be SOMETHING in the house for adults…so easy to lose sight of that when there are little ones around. It sounds like you have smartly found a way to balance it all.
