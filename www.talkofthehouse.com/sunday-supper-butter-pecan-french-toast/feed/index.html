		<description><![CDATA[What a lovely Valentine&#039;s meal, so fun. Liking the dishes from Michael&#039;s. I enjoyed reading the comments, too, we all really enjoy our breakfast for dinner. Growing up, my mom would do bacon and eggs or waffles, occasionally, for dinner in the winter. It was so much fun for me, but as others posted, it was probably a break for her! I&#039;m not a huge French toast fan, but up here in New England, a Portuguese sweet bread or a Jewish challah bread is frequently used in restaurants for a very decadent &quot;stuffed&quot; French toast. It is really over the top with the fruit or fruit and cream cheese (or mascarpone)baked between bread slices. It&#039;s like dessert! We are on school vacation, and am guessing your break is soon. Enjoy the fourteenth and the upcoming time off
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Your stuffed French toast sounds divine!  I love mascarpone cheese, and it would certainly add a richness to the bread dish.  Yum!

		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
Sorry to be late to your party...we love breakfast for dinner.  This menu is a keeper for after we get back into our house...the hardwood floors are being refinished and we&#039;re staying with friends.
xo,
Karen

&lt;em&gt;It is more than alright to be &quot;late to the party&quot; since I appear to be late for everything!  (Too many irons in the fire.)  Hope your hardwood floors are finished and you are back in your home by now..with beautiful floors!
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;
