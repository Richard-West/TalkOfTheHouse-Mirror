		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be saving this post in my &#039;places I want to visit&#039; post. I live just a few miles east of Tahlequah in northwest Arkansas &#038; actually have been there a few times when my son played basketball games there in high school.

I&#039;ve never been there to see the town though &#038; it looks like I&#039;m missing out. 

I found your blog through a Christmas pin on Pinterest. I loved your kitchen so much I decided to browse your blog &#038; will be looking forward to new posts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am glad your beautiful daughter is living her dream.  When I was in college I always wanted to work at Disney for a summer but never followed through with it. And, how wonderful that Hayley knows the importance of helping others through mission work. You have done a great job with your children, giving them roots and wings. I read Wilson Rawls, Summer of the Monkeys, to my third graders every year. They liked the book better than the movie as well, Louvina. (I could never read the book aloud without crying. Every year I thought I could, but no!)Making s&#039;mores in a restaurant looks fun! Cook&#039;s Companion looks like a store I would like to visit. My sister just gave me some cotton and I was thinking today that I need to see a cotton wreath...and there it was! Great post, Kelly! Now I must catch up and read your next post. I have been away at a wedding a few days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Our daughter is certainly going after her dreams.  I just hope she gets a position she loves when this one is over.  She has been interviewing at Disney for the last 2 weeks for different jobs, (like in hospitality - not entertainment) and she will know more next month.  If she gets one, she will be out of Disney housing and into her own apartment...which means loading up a truck and moving all of her things down there.  Fingers crossed for her!  
I think I read Summer of the Monkeys a very long time ago.  It seems to me that most books are better than the movies that are made from them.
The s&#039;mores grill was a lot of fun! (better than fondue!)
Good luck with your cotton wreath! It seems you have a wedding to attend every time you turn around. :)
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>
