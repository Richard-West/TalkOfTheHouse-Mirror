		<description><![CDATA[Savannah is one of my favorite cities! I just came across this post. I&#039;m headed to Savannah again this weekend. This time with a couple girlfriends from high school. We are leaving the hubby&#039;s at home :)

My favorite things to do in Savannah are:

1. Visit Bonaventure Cemetery~ It is so beautiful there. Shannon Scott does a tour best to go the in daytime. He is the best storyteller imo. The statues are amazing and he will tell you so many things about the history.

2. Dinner at Old Pink House~ It&#039;s one of the best restaurants I&#039;ve been to there. They have the best cheese grits!
3. Leopold&#039;s Ice cream is to die for.
4. Lunch at Mrs. Wilkes boarding house~ Only open during the week for like 3 hours a day. Go early the line will wrap around. It&#039;s on Jones St. The most beautiful and most photographed street in Savannah!
5. I love to stay in Bed and Breakfasts when I go to Savannah. I&#039;ve stayed at The Green Palm Inn and Kehoe House B&#038;B. Both were very nice.
6. The French onion soup at Five Pence Pub!!
7. You must take a Trolley tour to check everything out too!

Those are just some things I&#039;ve done.]]></description>
