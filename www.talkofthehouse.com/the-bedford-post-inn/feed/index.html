		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful Inn! Thank you for sharing it and all the lovely pictures! It is now on my list of places to travel. I think the Fall will be the perfect time to visit this place. My hubby and I were married in October in Long Island; staying here would make a nice Anniversary weekend!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband and I just got back from a wonderful trip to the Northeast.  We spent a night at the Black Point Inn in Scarborough, Maine.  We loved the entire area and also stayed at the Kennebunkport Inn in the downtown area of Kennebunkport.  George H W Bush and wife Barbara had eaten at the Inn the night before.  Of course we had to search out their beautiful compound.  Your post made that area our first stop.   We also stayed at the Aurora Inn in Aurora, NY, down the road from the Mackenzie Childs location.  Finally we stayed at the Sarah Kendall Inn a historical victorian home in Newport R I.  We stayed at some other nice hotels but really enjoyed the inns.   This was our first time to travel in the fall in many years as I had been teaching.  Fall is an amazing time to travel.  I look forward to more suggestions from your blog.

&lt;em&gt;Wow...what a dream of a trip, Donna!!!  You all did great!  My sons recently returned from a trip across the U.S., up the west coast, and into Canada.  I keep telling them they need to do a Northeast trip, but they do not believe me.  I can&#039;t wait until my husband and I are retired and can do a trip like yours in the fall.  Thanks for sharing!
