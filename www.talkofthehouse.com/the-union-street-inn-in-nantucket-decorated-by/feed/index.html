		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,

  Room 12 is my favorite also because of the fireplace. The blue and yellow combo is so peaceful too. Thanks for sharing some more of Trudy&#039;s style with us! Take care.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I have always loved blue and yellow...so fresh!  I didn&#039;t even think about the fireplace! Glad you liked seeing more of her work.
Kelly&lt;/em&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an amazing hotel.  The rooms are all so beautiful and inviting.  I would happily stay in any of them!  We have only been to Nantucket once and stayed at the White Elephant which we loved.  Hope you&#039;re having a great week!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;I thought it was amazing too.  You stayed at a wonderful place if you stayed at the White Elephant!  It is a classic on the island.  I would love to stay there as well.
