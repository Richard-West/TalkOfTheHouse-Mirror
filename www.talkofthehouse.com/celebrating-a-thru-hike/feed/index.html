		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to Wrinkles!  What an accomplishment!
I am e-mail pen pal with a lady in Ga. whom I have never met. But anyway, she and her spouse are AP trail volunteers.  They maintain a section of the trail in Ga., and she is always telling me about their get-togethers at an Inn for hikers.  And about how they maintain their part of the trail.  Perhaps they have met your Wrinkles along the way!  They hike most weekends, but have not been able for the last week or so, as her hubby had a health scare and is recovering as I write. I admire anyone who can do that hike, as I know I could never get a mile!!!]]></description>
