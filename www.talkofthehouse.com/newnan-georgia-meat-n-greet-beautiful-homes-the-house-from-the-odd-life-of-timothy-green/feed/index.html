		<description><![CDATA[Kelly,
What fun your daughter must have making all of those Frozen fans happy to see someone that looks so pretty.
I thought this town was charming beyond words.  There were so many pretty houses.  
The restaurant menu had me drooling.
What a great getaway day.
---------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;em&gt;Those little girls at the event were precious to see.  One grabbed my daughter&#039;s hand and told everyone that she was HER friend and no one else&#039;s. So glad you liked the houses and restaurant in the post.  It was a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon in a charming little Southern town.
You need to visit!
